            <p>Protect your investment against failure from wear-out for up to 4 years or 400,000 miles. Unlike other used truck warranties in the marketplace, Arrow's warranties include full coverage (not just major components) during the entire coverage period.</p>
            <p>We have class 8 coverage plans ranging from 6 months/50k miles to 48 months/400k miles and fit almost any need and budget. We also offer optional upgrades on transmission and rear axle parts coverage. <a href="/extended-semi-truck-warranties" target="_blank">View a full list of covered components here.</a></p>
            <p>If you experience a problem or breakdown on the road, your claim can be made 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Arrangements are made and you are informed of what immediate action to take. All paperwork and direct payments are made to the repair facility within hours. You make one call and repairs can be made at more than 3,000 recognized repair facilities. We only repair at authorized OEM facilities and use genuine OEM parts for repairs. You have one deductible and your liability for mechanical failure is only $150 per occurrence (subject to change).</p>

Unlike some of our competitors, our warranty includes all engine models and includes coverage on 42 vital system components for light, medium and heavy-duty diesel engines. We have plans available for 12, 24, 36 and 48 months. <a href="/semi-truck-aftertreatment-warranty" target="_blank">View covered components and sensors.</a></p>

Arrow's Gap Protection covers the difference so you won't still owe money on an asset that no longer exists.</p>

Protect your family's financial security by canceling any remaining balance on your loan and releases full ownership of your truck to your family, with no further financial strain. The cost of the waiver is only pennies per day and may be added to your loan balance and included in your monthly payment. No medical exam is required and the program has very few limitations.
