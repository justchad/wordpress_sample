You keep it clean and maintain both what is in the cab and under the hood. You realize that your truck is an investment. As an owner-operator, your big rig is your source of income. It is the tool of your trade; the means you use it to feed yourself and your family.</span>

You want to make sure that your investment allows you to “bring home the bacon.” You may have pondered integration and wondered what classification will help you enjoy maximum profit.<!--more-->

When it comes down to it, you can file for three different classifications of integration: S-Corp, C-Corp, or LLC (sole proprietorship). Each has different advantages and tax breaks. <strong>Before you choose one of these three options, consult a tax or legal advisor to ensure that it is the best move for you.</strong>

<em><strong>LLC (sole proprietorship)</strong></em>

An LLC is a great option because it afford you liability protection. You also avoid the taxation that corporations are subject to. An LLC is a great option for sole proprietorship, as it saves money, offers protection, and leaves open the opportunity to form future partnerships.

If you are a sole proprietorship LLC, you avoid double taxation. However, there are limits to your benefits and your potential for expansion. For this reason, many owner operators file for either C-Corp or S-Corp status.

<em><strong>C-Corp</strong></em>

Choosing the C-Corp option means that you have to pay an income tax (that corporations are subject to). Any shareholders you have pay individual income taxes, but are not subject to what is referred to as self-employment taxes when payouts are distributed.

The C-Corp route is usually the best option for owner-operators who do not want or do not qualify for sole proprietorship status and have a net income of under $70,000 a year.

<em><strong>S-Corp</strong></em>

If you make more than $70,000 a year, S-Corp status may save you tax money. Your taxable wages and SE/FICA taxes may be lowered. The downside is that there is additional cost integrated into S-Corp status (think of it as a large process and handling fee) that negates some of the tax savings.

Be sure to counsel with you financial or legal advisor before filing for an S-Corp.

As you know, your automatic on-board recording device (AOBRD) is required by law to display certain information. But as of May 2014, the information required to be displayed has changed as announced by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). As of now, your AOBRD must be capable of displaying the following:

<strong>The Information Required for Display</strong><!--more-->
<ul>
 	<li>Driver’s total hours of driving on the present day</li>
 	<li>Driver’s total hours on duty on the present day</li>
 	<li>Total miles driven on the present day</li>
 	<li>Total hours on duty for the 7 consecutive day period, including the present day</li>
 	<li>Total hours on duty for the prior 8 consecutive day period, including the present day</li>
 	<li>The sequential changes in duty status and the times the changes occurred for each driver using the device</li>
</ul>
<strong>Regulation on Printing Information</strong>

While additional information is required to be recorded by your device, only the information listed above is required to be <em>displayed</em>. And though your AOBRD is required to display this information, it does not have to have the capability to print the information out, though an enforcement official can request that you email or fax the information within 48 hours.

<strong>How This Came About</strong>

It was brought to the FMCSA’s attention that inspection officials request information from AOBRDs about a driver’s record of duty status (RODS) in order to see if drivers are HOS compliant. In some cases, inspection officials have issued citations when AOBRDs did not display certain information.

The reason for the publication of the new regulation is to address what information is required to be displayed and whether or not that information has to be printed. With the new regulation, drivers, owners of trucking companies, and inspection officials will know what is and is not required of the driver.

<strong>What If My Device Doesn’t Comply?</strong>

If you’ve realized that your AOBRD doesn’t comply with the new regulation, you’ll need to update your device soon before you are stopped by enforcement. Have a device that can’t be updated? You (or most likely your trucking company) will need to buy a new one.

,,,,,,default_layout,,,,"Resource Center",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,42,"There are a few obvious benefits that come from buying a used truck: there’s the lower price tag and insurance rate, just to name a few. But what other advantages are you missing out on by buying a new vehicle? Here are three you may not have considered:

1. Certification Programs

Most manufacturers have implemented certified pre-owned programs for their used vehicles. While the price tag on a CPO vehicle may be higher than the typical used vehicle, there are a variety of benefits that make up the cost, including:<!--more-->

• Warranty. A CPO warranty will typically extend past original factory warranty—meaning that you can take advantage of features like road-side assistance.
• Value. To receive certification, a vehicle must undergo cosmetic and mechanical inspection. So when you purchase a CPO vehicle, you know you’re getting something valuable. What’s more, in most cases, these vehicles have low-mileage and no history of major damage.

All in all, taking advantage of the certification trend can make your used car purchase a successful experience.

2. Avoiding Depreciation

When you buy a new vehicle, a steep decline in value happens almost immediately. In fact, some models lose as much as 40% of their value within the first year. Fortunately, buying used can help you avoid that level of depreciation. If you’re interested in learning how much a vehicle will be worth in the future, check out some used-car value guides to give yourself an idea.

3. Less Money Spent on Sales Tax and Registration Fees

When you buy used, you’ll obviously be looking at vehicles with a lower price tag. But did you know that you can also save on sales tax and registration fees? It’s true! Many states require sales tax on new car truck purchases, but not on used. And annual registration fees are dependent on the vehicle’s age and value. If the vehicle you purchase is more than five years old, you can end up saving thousands of dollars!

By making a smart purchase, you can take advantage of these benefits and more. As you shop around, be sure to test drive your options and check for problems like trouble shifting gears, oil or coolant leaks, etc. Buying used comes with its own set of hazards, so take the time to inspect a vehicle before making a purchase. By doing so, you’ll be able to see firsthand why buying used is a better alternative to buying new.",,"2014-06-30 22:40:26",post,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/2014/06/30/why-buy-new-when-you-can-buy-used-3-advantages-you-havent-considered/,publish,1,ATSBlogM,schaiyote@arrowtruck.com,,,why-buy-new-when-you-can-buy-used-3-advantages-you-havent-considered,,,0,0,0,closed,closed,"2014-06-30 22:40:26"

You probably see them so often that you may think nothing of it. But did you know that the economy relies so heavily on the trucking industry that you could confidently call truckers the backbone of America?</span>

Trucking drives the economy by allowing companies to ship goods and services from coast to coast. Consumers have access to the goods they need, and companies can expand their businesses, leading to more locations, more jobs, and still more goods. Thanks to the trucking industry, local and nationwide economies can boom and flourish.<!--more-->

<strong>How Truckers Changed Our Country</strong>

Since the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, trucking has changed the shape of business in America. Originally, companies and consumers could only transport goods by train and horse-drawn carriage, which severely limited the speed and reach of shipping. Some train companies would even charge unfair fright rates when companies tried to ship goods across the country.

People needed a cost-effective, flexible, far-reaching alternative.

<em>The Early 20<sup>th</sup> Century</em>

With the invention of the automobile, companies and consumers could travel to more places at reasonable speeds. Manufacturers recognized the shipping and hauling potential of the automobile, so they slowly adapted their vehicles into the pickup trucks and semi-trucks we know today.

Before WWI, trucks could only travel at 15 mph. But the war accelerated the development of this technology, leading to inflated tires and a diesel engine, which gave trucks greater speed and power. By 1920, a fleet of over a million trucks helped companies (and military entities) ship goods all over the country.

<em>The Mid-20<sup>th</sup> Century</em>

Before the trucking industry took off, the country didn’t have any interstates. Sure, you could take highways and different roads to other states, but there weren’t any major interstate highways. You did not have the convenience of taking I-80 from San Francisco to Detroit.

In 1941, a committee commissioned by President Roosevelt drafted the first plans for a series of interstate highways. This highways would boost the trucking industry and improve shipping rates (and the standard of living) all around the country. Companies could not only ship goods at an affordable price, but they could ship goods quickly, allowing them to ship refrigerated foods.

<em>The Late 20<sup>th</sup> Century</em>

The late 20<sup>th</sup> century saw the rise of trucker culture and the use of CB radios. CB radios allowed truck drivers to warn other drivers of impending dangers like landslides, traffic jams, toll roads, and more. This enabled drivers to avoid these delays and find other routes instead, ensuring that their freights would arrive on time.

Today, the trucking industry still plays a vital role in our economy. It has had to overcome speed bumps like rising fuel prices and emissions regulations, but it still continues to serve companies and consumers all around the country, bringing them the goods and services they desire.

<strong>By the Numbers: How Trucking Continues to Serve Our Country</strong>

Truckers provide a lot of important services:
<ul>
	<li>They take raw goods from local supplies and transport them to manufacturers.</li>
	<li>They take finished goods from manufacturers to retailers or to ports, where the goods will travel by sea or air to other destinations around the globe. This boost the worldwide economy.</li>
	<li>They also transport goods directly from retailers to consumers in some cases.</li>
</ul>
But trucking also serves our country in other ways in addition to shipping:
<ul>
	<li>It provides millions of unionized and non-unionized people with jobs. The industry also works to treat its drivers well—a single strike could make a huge dent in our economy.</li>
	<li>The industry earns over $650 billion every year, which means it earns more than ¾ of the revenue for the entire commercial transportation industry. It circulates a <em>lot</em> of revenue through our economy.</li>
	<li>Truckers travel more than 47,000 miles and carry over 12.9 trillion tons of freight every year. The specialized goods in your grocery store or department store may have travelled thousands of miles to reach you, and you never would have seen them at all without the efforts of a dedicated driver.</li>
	<li>The trucking industry also has a lot of political clout, so it has the potential to improve road safety. Members of the trucking industry work with legal experts to establish standards like lower speed limits and required resting time. These standards not only protect truck drivers, but the drivers around them, leading to fewer injuries and deaths.</li>
</ul>
Without the trucking industry, the economy would fall apart. Most businesses would completely fail because they wouldn’t have access to raw materials or finished goods. Your household would suffer as well because you wouldn’t have access to the fresh foods you need—especially during the winter when trucks bring fruits and vegetables from warmer climates.

So if you’re a truck driver, pat yourself on the back. You provide a very important service to this country. And if you know any truck drivers, make sure you thank them for all their hard work. Our country wouldn't be the same without their dedicated efforts.",,"2014-08-28 20:02:56",post,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/2014/08/28/when-the-trucks-stop-america-stops-the-importance-of-truckers-in-america/,publish,1,ATSBlogM,schaiyote@arrowtruck.com,,,when-the-trucks-stop-america-stops-the-importance-of-truckers-in-america,,,0,0,0,closed,closed,"2017-05-08 18:35:44"

Or are you?

If you’re a first-time trucker, it can be difficult to adjust to your new lifestyle. Long hours on the road and limited interaction with your friends and family can be intimidating. You’ll need to make a lot of changes during the first few weeks and months as a trucker, but hopefully these tips and tricks will help you tough it out.<!--more-->

<strong>Adjusting to Life on the Road</strong>

The open road may seem like a vacation getaway compared to the typical office cubicle, but it isn’t always the breezy adventure you envision. You are responsible for shipping goods to people who need them, and if you’re not careful, you could put your vehicle, your cargo, yourself, and other drivers at risks.

As you make adjustments in your life, it’s important to keep the following suggestions in mind.

<em>While on the Road</em>
<ul>
	<li><em>Take regular breaks</em>. You may be mentally prepared to drive for 24/7, but physically, your body will need a break. Every few hours, pull over and take the time to stretch your legs. It may be tempting to haul your truck for longer, but taking regular breaks will increase blood flow to your body and brain, helping you feel more alert.</li>
	<li><em>Bring healthy snacks</em>. You will be spending a lot of time sitting, which means you won’t be able to hit the gym on a regular basis. While you can do a few exercises during your break time, a lot of your health will depend on what you choose to eat—gas station meals won’t always cut it.</li>
	<li><em>Keep safety in mind</em>. Your truck is likely double or triple the size of the other vehicles on the road. While this may make you feel like the king of the road, your safety and the safety of others should always be your top priority. Don’t forget to buckle up, and keep your distance when you drive.</li>
	<li><em>Get plenty of sleep</em>. Depending on the job, you may have to drive for most of the day to meet your destination deadline. For tighter schedules, it can be tempting to cut back on sleep. However, sleepy driving is dangerous driving. You need to be awake and alert whenever you get behind the wheel, so do yourself a favor and get as much sleep as you need.</li>
</ul>
<em>While at Home</em>
<ul>
	<li><em>Keep your family in the loop.</em> Truckers spend almost 300 days away from home every year, depending on the company and the demand for their goods. Your family will miss you, so take pictures and videos that you can share. Also be sure to call or text them during rest stops so they know you’re doing fine.</li>
	<li><em>Communicate with your spouse.</em> Good relationships are hard to maintain when you’re away for long periods. While you’ll want to keep the phone lines open for your family when you’re on the road, it’s also important to discuss important issues with your spouse when you’re at home. Be understanding of your spouse’s needs and never leave home under stress.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Adjusting to Your Truck</strong>

While trucks all function in the same way on a basic level, each truck also has its unique quirks and features that will make driving more interesting (or more difficult). It’s important to get to know your truck inside and out so you can spot potential problems before they happen.
<ul>
	<li><em>Get to Know Your Blind Spots.</em> Also known as the “No-Zone,” the blind spots on a big rig are much larger than those in a smaller vehicle. While some rigs warn other drivers about these zones, it’s still important to understand where your blind spots are so you can exercise appropriate caution.</li>
	<li><em>Drive with a “Space Cushion.</em>” No, a space cushion is not a comfortable cushion from space. Instead, it’s the extra distance you put between yourself and other vehicles. Trucks can’t stop on a dime, so give yourself extra room in case of an emergency. The amount of space you give yourself should depend on whether you’re driving at night, the quality of your brakes, and the size of your vehicle.</li>
	<li><em>Be Careful With Curves.</em> Professional truck drivers slow down for turns. If you turn too quickly, you could roll your rig. Allow for the distance and speed of other vehicles when turning across traffic. Because right turns are tighter than left turns, you may need to veer left before turning right to give your truck adequate space.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Have Fun!</strong>

While trucking might not be ideal for some, you picked this job for a reason, and it can be amazing when you approach it with the right attitude. If you’re prepared to make a few adjustments, you’ll be ready to face whatever the road brings your way.

,,,,,,default_layout,,,,"Resource Center",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,50,"Thinking about new equipment for your business? Want to upgrade the equipment you already own? If you have considered investing in a new rig and don’t know where to begin, your search starts here.

<strong>Finding the Right Rig</strong>

The best place to start with any major investment is to ask yourself questions. What do you plan to use your truck for? How much do you have to spend? If you want to upgrade, make a list of improvements you would make to the current equipment you have. This should give you a clearer picture of what make and model you should buy to meet your needs and your budget.<!--more-->

<em>Research for the Right Truck</em>

Finding the right truck will also require you to do some research. Use reputable sources online to research what trucks are available. Read multiple sites and reviews to compare and come to your own conclusions about which truck is best for you, based on your individual needs.

Many tools online will give you access to used car and truck information. You should get access to as much information as you can before going through with the purchase. You will want to know the history of the truck—like if it has experienced any major accidents. Check Kelley Blue Book or NADA guides to search the make and model of the truck you want and get its current value. This information will help you later if you need to negotiate the price.

<em>Get the Truck’s Financial History</em>

If you want to buy from an independent seller, you may want to get access to the truck’s financial history. Be cautious in these dealings to avoid scams. The truck could be worthless if it’s technically owned by a bank or has been stolen. The best way to ensure that you are making a good deal is to buy a used truck from a dealership.

<strong>Take It for a Spin</strong>

Now you’ve done the hard part: deciding what you need. So now you need to put your truck to the test. If you buy from a dealership, contact them to make sure they have the one you want available to look at. When you go in for your test drive, prepare yourself with questions and concerns you might want cleared up.

The dealer can usually provide the best solutions because they are the experts and work with many individuals who have varying demands and preferences. Discuss what you are looking for and be open to their ideas and insights—they might think of something you hadn’t or offer a better fit.

Inspect the trucks you may want to buy and take them for a drive, and don’t feel pressured to make any snap decisions right after your test drive. You will want to have the one you choose inspected before signing any paperwork.

<strong>Have It Inspected</strong>

Unless you have the expertise to conduct a thorough inspection yourself, you should have a mechanic look over the truck you want to ensure it passes inspection.

Here are some of the main things to look over on the body and in the cab:
<ul>
	<li>Examine the frame for cracks, welds, bends, or rust.</li>
	<li>Inspect the fuel lines for potential leaks.</li>
	<li>Inspect the windshield for any chips or cracks.</li>
	<li>Test the windows, mirrors, door, locks, radio, and adjust the seat to make sure everything is in good working condition.</li>
	<li>Check wiring and hoses for loose connections or corrosion.</li>
	<li>Examine fuel tank traps for wear, slippage, and leaks.</li>
	<li>Examine headlights to make sure they are clear and not rusty.</li>
	<li>Make sure that the oil tube is free from condensed water vapor.</li>
	<li>Inspect the fifth wheel lock, as well as, the trailer service lines and glad-hands connectors.</li>
</ul>
You will also need to check the brakes, suspension, and tires to make sure they meet safety standards. Commercial trucks operate more like a piece of heavy machinery than an ordinary car, so you should err on the side of caution and always have a mechanic check it over.

<strong>Negotiate the Price and Finance</strong>

This last step of <em>actually</em> finalizing your purchase will vary depending on who you buy your truck from. You may have better luck negotiating the price with an individual seller. But you may have an easier time getting financing when you go through a dealer.

Provided that you did your homework and had the tuck inspected, you have the ability to negotiate a fair deal. You can present the dealer with the Kelley Blue Book estimated value and come to terms with any repairs that the truck needs to be reliable and safe. For example, the dealer might keep the price the same, but agree to put new tires on.

Next, you will need to choose a bank or lender and make a down payment. Your financial institution will need documentation, like your CDL, credit score, and annual income. Once you are approved, you can finalize the documents and pat yourself on the back—you did it. You are the proud new owner of a great truck.",,"2014-08-06 20:45:46",post,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/2014/08/06/how-to-buy-a-used-truck/,publish,1,ATSBlogM,schaiyote@arrowtruck.com,,,how-to-buy-a-used-truck,,,0,0,0,closed,closed,"2014-08-06 20:45:46"

This is not only best practice for the industry but also a federal law. An impaired driver should never operate a commercial vehicle. Driver impairments includes sickness, mental fatigue, and sleep deprivation.

But how do you make sure you drivers are getting the sleep they need? Is there anything they can do to decrease impairment? Listed below are a number of ways your drivers can get the rest they need, stay healthy, and avoid incident and impairment.<!--more-->

<strong>Get Better Sleep</strong>

The most important thing a driver can do to prevent impaired driving is to get enough sleep. But a driver’s work schedule can make finding time to sleep difficult.  Even though their busy schedule dictates their sleeping hours, drivers can maximize the quality of their sleep with the following techniques..

<em>Block out the sun:</em> A driver may only be able to find sleep in the middle of the day, so the challenge becomes how to block out the sun. Light irritates those trying to sleep, making it difficult to reach a true REM cycle.

Most OTR trucks come equipped with an area for sleep. Make sure this area has thick curtains to block as much light as possible. To dim a truck’s sleep space further, place a reflective sun shade in the windshield.

Drivers can also use a sleep mask to achieve complete darkness.

<em>Keep it quiet:</em> Noise keeps people awake. Whether it’s the sound of people talking, or the noise of passing cars on the highway, any sound can keep a driver from getting the required sleep they need to avoid impairment.

Make sure the curtain that divides the sleep berth from the rest of the cab is noise-cancelling. Drivers can also use white noise machines, sleep-aid soundtracks, and other soothing sounds to help get the rest they need.

Ear plugs are also useful in this situation. For those heavy sleepers who may need help waking up, some alarms clocks vibrate as well as make noise to wake a person up.

<em>Get off the road:</em> To fall into a deep and restful sleep, drivers should avoid trying to sleep on the side of the road. Traffic will vibrate the cab of the truck, making sleep increasingly difficult to achieve.

Rest stops and truck stops are two of the most common places to find peace and quiet during a haul. But these two locations often fill up the fastest as well.

Where possible, have your drivers plan ahead where they will stop for sleep. They should include a few back-up places with additional parking. Remember that some towns and cities may have laws dictating where a driver can park a rig overnight.

<strong>Stay Healthy</strong>

Being on the road makes it tough for a driver to stay in good shape. As discussed, getting a good night’s rest is the most important thing for a driver to do to stay healthy and alert. But your drivers can and should do a few other things to promote a healthy lifestyle while on the road.

With frequent stops at convenience stores, truck drivers have abundant access to unhealthy foods. To keep from junking out, drivers should prepare nutritious meals and healthy snacks so they can avoid sugary and fattening alternatives. Nuts, fruits, and raw vegetables are a great source of energy and help the body to stay alert and attentive throughout the day.

Your drivers also need to have plenty of water on hand. A cup of coffee or a sugary drink is okay in moderation, but nothing beats water at keeping a body in tip-top shape.

Staying healthy is not just about the food you eat—it also includes the things you do. Driving for long periods of time could lead to a decreased motivation to exercise. Making time to exercise helps anyone’s mind and body stay energetic. Encourage your drivers to schedule at least 30 minutes a day for exercise to get the heart rate up and the blood pumping.

If your drivers don’t have 30 minutes at a time to spend exercising, have them break up their exercise into segments. For example, they can put in 10 minutes before breakfast, lunch, and dinner. At the very least, make sure your drivers schedule time to get out and walk around every few hours.

<strong>Make a Plan and Stick to it</strong>

Finally, to stick to a solid sleep schedule and stay healthy, your drivers need to be expert planners. From pick up to delivery, they need to be able to schedule their way to the destination. This includes planning stops for gas, food, and sleep. A thoughtful planner accounts for potential traffic and unexpected delays.

Teach your drivers to make a plan and stick to it as close as possible, but they also need a fair amount of flexibility. Knowing how to adjust to the unexpected can decrease your drivers’ stress from delays and improve their ability rest when the time comes.

Above all, remember safe driving is the responsibility of both the driver and the company. Make sure that your drivers are physically and mentally able to complete the task assigned and that they always schedule time for rest.",,"2014-09-12 23:18:01",post,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/2014/09/12/making-sure-your-truck-drivers-get-enough-sleep/,publish,1,ATSBlogM,schaiyote@arrowtruck.com,,,making-sure-your-truck-drivers-get-enough-sleep,,,0,0,0,closed,closed,"2017-05-08 18:35:33"

They make the decisions that keep shipments and vehicles safe.

In order for your drivers to perform their best, they need to stay healthy. But between truck stop cuisine and hours of driving, they may have a hard time maintaining their health. Use these tips to keep your drivers healthy and alert as they travel from place to place.<!--more-->

<strong>1. Avoid sugary drinks.</strong>

That energy or fountain drink delivers a fast punch of energy in the mornings. Unfortunately, it brings some undesirable consequences along with it. Since a truck driver spends most of his or her time behind the wheel, their body doesn’t use up the energy and stores it as fat instead.

This happens with any sugary food, but since soda, energy drinks, and sports drinks often turn into a mealtime staple, the empty calories contribute more to bad health than other foods.

<strong>2. Eat healthy sugars instead.</strong>

Cookies, doughnuts, and other energy-boosting foods have sucrose. To get the same boost without eating unhealthy foods, your drivers should eat fructose instead. Fructose comes in fruits and other natural foods, including:
<ul>
	<li>Grapes</li>
	<li>Applies</li>
	<li>Smoothies</li>
	<li>Parfaits (with Greek yogurt)</li>
	<li>Energy/granola bars</li>
	<li>Dark chocolate</li>
</ul>
However, because these foods have sugar, drivers should still eat them in moderation.

<strong>3. Choose the right foods at truck stops.</strong>

Truck stop food often has about as much nutrition as fast food, but that doesn’t mean that your drivers have to consign themselves to salty, sugary, greasy, or fatty meals. Most truck stops carry these healthy foods in addition to their normal selection:
<ul>
	<li>Yogurt</li>
	<li>Low-fat string cheese</li>
	<li>Nuts, sunflower seeds, mini pretzels, and trail mix</li>
	<li>Beef jerky</li>
	<li>Chicken or turkey sandwiches</li>
	<li>Tuna salad</li>
</ul>
Any food can keep drivers healthy if eaten in moderation. But since your drivers will have to eat truck stop or restaurant food several times a day as they travel, they should try to stick to healthier options.

<strong>4. Keep healthy snacks in the car.</strong>

Light, low-calorie snacks not only keep hunger pangs at bay, but they prevent overeating as well. At the end of a long day of driving, anyone would want to have a hearty, satisfying meal, but a large meal late at night often leads to weight gain. And weight gain comes with its own set of consequences.

These small, filling snacks will prevent the need for large meals:
<ul>
	<li>Precooked brown rice</li>
	<li>Whole wheat rolls</li>
	<li>Bananas</li>
	<li>Apples</li>
	<li>Spinach, kale, lettuce, and other leafy greens</li>
	<li>Soybeans</li>
	<li>Precooked beans</li>
	<li>Nuts</li>
	<li>Peanut butter</li>
</ul>
Any other fruits, vegetables, and sources of light protein make great snacks. Just remember to eat only a few snacks at a time.

<strong>5. Practice portion control.</strong>

As mentioned before, drivers must eat the things they want in moderation. Everyone has to practice portion control, but people who spend most of their days sitting have to eat even more carefully. An entire meal shouldn’t look bigger than two fists.

Drivers should also try to eat bigger meals for breakfast and lunch and a smaller meal for dinner. Sleep slows the metabolism, so any undigested dinner will store as fat instead of turning into energy. If drivers eat a smaller meal at dinner, they’ll stay fitter.

<strong>6. Avoid truck stop food and restaurant food entirely.</strong>

Depending on the length of the drive, truck drivers could pack their own food in a cooler and eat that instead. Homemade food tends to have fewer calories than restaurant food—and it doesn’t cost nearly as much either.

<strong>7. Exercise regularly.</strong>

A healthy diet wins only half the battle. Exercise conquers the other half. But since truck drivers have a very busy schedule, they may skip on exercise so they can sleep. Exercise doesn’t have to take very long though. These activities take only a few minutes:
<ul>
	<li><em>Bicycling: </em>Folding bicycles fit nicely in the cab of a semi, and drivers can unfold them and bike around for a few minutes at rest stops.</li>
	<li><em>Weight lifting:</em> Drivers can lift weights at rest stops or along empty stretches of road. As long as they keep their eyes on the road and one hand on the wheel, they could exercise the other arm.</li>
	<li><em>Running/walking: </em>Even a short walk will help drivers burn calories and stay a little healthier. They could even walk around the truck stop.</li>
</ul>
As long as your drivers follow all these tips, they’ll stay healthy and alert on the road, leading to higher efficiency for your business. Even if you already have an efficient business, bring your drivers to the next performance level: use these tips to keep your drivers happier, healthier, and more effective than ever.

,,,,,,default_layout,6,,,"Resource Center",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,59,"Imagine a long, empty stretch of highway without a city in sight. There's nothing to see but endless miles of road. After a while, the empty landscape racing on either side of you becomes hypnotic. It's late, and you've been driving for hours. Slowly your eyelids become heavier and heavier. Your fight against falling sleep seems like a hopeless battle.

Sound familiar?

<!--more-->

Driving fatigue is a real issue with real consequences. Drowsy driving accounts for more than 100,000 crashes a year. Around 37% of drivers report falling asleep or nodding off while driving. According to a Gallup estimate, in the last month, 7.5 million drivers nodded off while driving.

But America runs on the wheels of semi-trucks. Overnight driving is not going to go away. In order to protect everyone on the road, you and your drivers need to know proper methods for staying awake during long, overnight drives. The following suggestions can help keep you and your drivers safe, alert, and responsible.

<strong>Prepare for the Drive</strong>

An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. It's easier to prevent yourself from getting drowsy than it is to wake yourself up. You can prevent drowsy driving through proper preparation.
<ul>
	<li><em>Consistent, significant sleep: </em>Make sure to get at least 7 hours of sleep consistently for 3-5 days before the trip. Some drivers think that one solid night of sleep will make up for a week of restless nights, which is simply not true.</li>
	<li><em>Condition your body:</em> Adjust to your driving schedule before the trip if at all possible. If you have to drive overnight, start sleeping during the day and staying up at night for 3-5 days beforehand.</li>
	<li><em>Stock your truck:</em> Make sure to pack some easy to grab snacks. Consider creating a playlist of songs specifically designed to keep you awake on some of the longer stretches of road.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Adjust the Car</strong>

Everything from the position of the seat to the temperature in the car can affect your drive. Create an ideal driving environment in your truck.
<ul>
	<li><em>Reposition your seat: </em>Put your seat in a new position. As soon as you get used to the position and it starts to feel natural, adjust it again. The change will help to revitalize you and keep you from getting too comfortable. Of course, make sure you can still use your mirrors and drive safely.</li>
	<li><em>Cool down:</em> It is harder to fall asleep when you are cold. Roll down your windows for a while or turn on the air conditioning. Make sure it is cold enough to keep you awake and alert, but warm enough to still think and function properly.</li>
	<li><em>Turn on the lights: </em>Part of the reason it is so easy to fall asleep while driving at night is because it is dark. Consider turning on the light if you start to feel particularly drowsy.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Move Your Body</strong>

Moving around will help you stay more alert and prevent you from falling asleep. Remember to consider safety in all of your actions.
<ul>
	<li><em>Stop cruising:</em> Turn off cruise control. While it can be convenient, the physical action of applying pressure to the gas and brake pedals can help keep you awake.</li>
	<li><em>Dance:</em> Put on a favorite playlist and dance in your seat. Don't go crazy—safety is important, and you shouldn't allow yourself to get distracted. But simply swaying in your seat can help keep you more awake.</li>
	<li><em>Eat: </em>Eat something you can easily pop in your mouth like chips or popcorn. Eat these snacks one at a time so your arm has to keep moving. Avoid heavy foods that will make you sleepy. Stay away from high-sugar foods well—you'll get more energy at first, but what goes up must go down. The crash is not worth the high.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Take a Break</strong>

It is important to realize when you are drowsy enough to be a danger to yourself and others. Sometimes the best choice is to take a short break.
<ul>
	<li><em>Cat nap: </em>Pull over at a rest stop or a gas station, turn off the lights and radio, and take a nap. If you are nowhere near a rest stop, find a safe place to pull over on the side of the road and take a nap.</li>
	<li><em>Walk around:</em> At the next exit, find a gas station, rest stop, or even a parking lot and take a quick walk around. The walk will get your blood pumping and reinvigorate you.</li>
	<li><em>Exercise:</em> Find a safe place to pull over, put on your hazard lights, get out of the truck, and start doing some jumping jacks. If you can do this at a rest stop, great, but you can pull over anywhere with a significant shoulder and start doing jumping jacks. Always maintain a safe distance from the road and make sure your truck is visible to drivers.</li>
</ul>
Late-night driving is sometimes a necessity, but that is no excuse to forget safety. Help keep your truck company accident-free. Teach your drivers proper methods for staying awake and alert, and make sure to follow them yourself the next time you're on the road.",,"2014-10-24 21:54:44",post,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/2014/10/24/live-to-drive-another-day-12-tricks-to-stay-awake-on-the-road/,publish,1,ATSBlogM,schaiyote@arrowtruck.com,,,live-to-drive-another-day-12-tricks-to-stay-awake-on-the-road,,,0,0,0,closed,closed,"2017-05-08 18:35:26"
,,,,,,default_layout,2,,,"Resource Center",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,61,"Making the choice to be a commercial truck driver is not something to rush into. Truck driving presents a unique lifestyle for those who do it, perhaps even more than other career choices. As with any job, you should consider the hours, benefits, location, job security, and earning potential.

Along with these factors, knowing the pros and cons of truck driving will contribute to your final decision. Just remember, what’s a problem for one person may be a benefit for another. The most vital part of this process is asking yourself questions so you know your own preferences.

<!--more-->

If you’re feeling overwhelmed, that’s okay. To break it down for you, we’ve developed a “pros and cons” list to help you see the different sides of a truck driver’s life. After reading through this list, you’ll know if truck driving fits your personality, lifestyle, and professional goals.

Neither the pros nor cons sections are exhaustive. But, we’d like to point out a few of the good and not-as-good parts of commercial truck driving.

<strong>Benefits of Truck Driving</strong>

Plenty of people consider solitude an ideal aspect in a working environment. Truck driving gives ample opportunity for thoughtful contemplation, self-assessment, and self-help.

It’s a common occurrence for drivers to invest in self-help books on CD to make use of the long hours on the road. Whatever you’re interested in, there’s an audiobook that talks about it. Truck driving allows for on-the-job learning and even the pursuit of hobbies and interests.

If travel is something you’re interested in, why not get paid to do it? The continental US holds a variety of scenery and cultures. Drivers enjoy getting to know the land as they get to know themselves. Adventure, travel, and experience are all up for grabs when you choose to be a commercial truck driver.

An added perk is being your own boss. Each driver has a dispatcher which they report to and receive tasks from, but drivers still makes day-to-day decisions for themselves. Why not opt to have a job where you are the one who makes the call?

Truck drivers take their breaks, arrange fuel stops, and even chart their own course depending on the company policy. With you in the driver’s seat, there’s a lot of freedom you won’t find in other industries. If you are a self-starter and like to do things your way, you might enjoy this business.

There are also several financial benefits to being a commercial truck driver. Although first-time drivers make anywhere between $20,000 and $40,000 annually, pay depends on mileage. If you build your experience and keep a clean driving record, your pay potential dramatically increases.

In fact, owner operators can make up to $160,000 annually with experience increases. Depending on your employer, experience, and record, your annual income could pay for a comfortable living.

As a commercial truck driver, you may have more opportunity to make large sums without expensive years of schooling. That means truck driving can provide a great way to begin saving money for investments. But with great earning potential comes great responsibility, so be aware of what you’re giving to get paid.

<strong>Considering the Downsides</strong>

Any commercial or “over the road” truck driver will tell you that your truck becomes your home. If you are having trouble imagining life away from home for periods of 2-3 weeks at a time, this career may not be for you. Of course, it’s always a good idea to check what the company policy is for time off. Some jobs may be more flexible than others, but make sure you’re prepared to stick with what you’re given.

Long hours also involve odd wake and sleep times. Most drivers will sleep through the day and drive through the night to avoid traffic. Because truck drivers are usually paid per mile, they want to make the most of their driving time. By that token, it makes sense to take advantage of the less busy times on the road, even if that means having an odd sleep schedule.

People-oriented employees may struggle with the long stretches of solitude and wait times. It can be difficult to spend endless time with nothing but your thoughts, but some people enjoy this aspect.

In addition to the odd hours, time away from home, and solitude, this job requires planning and responsibility. Directionally challenged drivers would do well to stay away from this vocation. Although some aspects of trucking might seem undesirable, many prefer them to the alternatives found in other careers.

<strong>Weighing Your Options</strong>

Just like with any job, commercial truck driving is not for everyone. Take the time to discuss the impacts this career will have on you and your family, as well as considering the lifestyle it requires. Go into the  industry with eyes wide open to avoid surprises so you are aware of what you’re able to lose—and gain—from a career as a truck driver.",,"2014-10-24 21:55:24",post,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/2014/10/24/can-you-hack-the-truck-driver-lifestyle/,publish,1,ATSBlogM,schaiyote@arrowtruck.com,,,can-you-hack-the-truck-driver-lifestyle,,,0,0,0,closed,closed,"2017-05-08 18:35:19"
,,,,,,default_layout,11,,,"Resource Center",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,68,"Keeping a semi-truck clean is a big job. When truckers spend so much time on the road, they have little cleaning time, and they live in a fairly limited space. That means the truck's cabin can get messy pretty fast.

Why is keeping your truck clean so important? For one thing, it helps make a good impression as you travel across the country…you’re a <em>professional driver </em>and you want to project that image to everyone. Additionally, it vastly increases your trucks' future resale values. If you're planning on selling your truck and upgrading at a future date, you can't afford not to keep your truck spotlessly clean.

<!--more-->

You could always pay to have someone clean your interior - or you could save time and money by knowing the ins and outs of cleaning your truck. Of course, most experienced truckers know how to detail their own truck. But the following information can serve as a helpful reminder, and introduce any new drivers to the importance of a clean truck.

<strong>1. Clear out Old Trash</strong>

Over a single trip, any number of things accumulate in the cabin. Trash means crumbs, stains, and even odd smells. Get rid of old chip bags, beef jerky wrappers, soda cans, and sandwich bags. Keep a trash bag in the cabin to keep things neat and tidy.

Remember not to wait until you're done cleaning to clear out trash. Shaking out all those crumbs after you've cleaned and polished the truck will make a bigger mess than you started with.

<strong>2. Vacuum</strong>

First, remove any floor mats, then vacuum the floors and seats. Use a long vacuum attachment to clean the hard-to-reach areas around the pedals, between the seats, under the seats, and around the dashboard. Shake out the mats and replace them, then vacuum them thoroughly as well.

<strong>3. Clean the Dashboard</strong>

You can also use a soft brush attachment to delicately vacuum the dashboard. However, you should be careful not to damage any of the knobs or dials on the dashboard; be particularly gentle. If you'd rather not vacuum the dashboard (or if there isn't enough dust on the dashboard to warrant it), use a gentle cleaner and soft cloth to clean it off.

Avoid cleaners or polishes that have a glossy or shiny finish. This can cause glare that interferes with driving. If you're nervous about potential glare, use water instead of polish.

<strong>4. Remove Stains</strong>

If you find stains on the front seat's upholstery, you'll need to do more than vacuum. Use warm, soapy water to try to scrub out the stain. If that doesn't work, invest in an upholstery cleaner. Perform a spot test to make sure the cleaner won't further the damage. Then, apply the cleaning agent thoroughly and evenly across the stain. Read the cleaner's instructions to find out how long you should let the cleaner sit, then scrub the area clean.

You can remove carpet stains with this same method. Always apply the cleaner evenly, and always let the stained area dry out as quickly as possible after you clean it. Leaving the area wet for too long can lead to mold.

You shouldn't finish the floor mats with any kind of coating or dressing to prevent stains. These kinds of finishes can stick to the driver's shoes, which makes them too slick to correctly work the pedals.

Remember that the sooner you remove a stain, the higher your chances are of getting it out for good. Keep upholstery cleaning supplies in your truck  to take care of spills as soon as they happen.

<strong>5. Treat the Leather</strong>

Leather seats require different cleaning products than upholstered seats. Still, some of the same principles apply. For instance, you should always spot check any leather cleaning products to see if they'll stain. You should also use a very soft, clean towel while cleaning to prevent scratching.

You can vacuum leather seats with the soft brush attachment, but be very gentle to avoid scratches. You can also apply a leather conditioner to protect the seats after cleaning them.

<strong>6. Replace the Air Filters</strong>

Unless the PM service facility replaces your truck's cabin air filter regularly, you are breathing dirty, unfiltered air. The cabin can also fill with a musty, unhealthy smell. Different truck models have different instructions for replacing air filters, so follow the owner's manual to clean or replace your truck's unique cabin air filter.

<strong>7. Clean the Windows</strong>

Use a gentle window cleaner to clean the inside and outside of windows. While newspaper will remove stains better than cloth on most windows, avoid newspaper on any tinted windows. The newspaper is too abrasive and can remove the tinting. Use a soft cloth instead.

<strong>8. Make Cleaning a Priority</strong>

Now that you know the basic steps for cleaning a truck's interior, it doesn't seem so hard or time-consuming. Stick to a strict cleaning regimen. Take the time to clean out your truck's interior after every major trip.

Even if you do your own cleaning, you should probably have your truck detailed by a specialist every once in a while.

Regular cleaning will save money in the long run and keep your “home away from home” a clean, comfortable and safe place.

,,,,,,default_layout,1,,,"Resource Center",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,72,"To keep your fleet running efficiently, your truck drivers must spend a lot of time out on the open road. While this job offers freedom, chances for personal advancement, and travel, long periods behind the wheel can also wreak havoc on your drivers' bodies.

Injured and achy drivers are more likely to make mistakes, which increases the risk of accidents, missed deadlines, and further injury. In fact, 41% of accidents involving semis are due to driver recognition factors or physical factors that affect the driver-like chronic pain. Help your drivers alleviate the negative side effects of frequent driving through the following methods.

<!--more-->

<strong>To Prevent Pain</strong>

Before your drivers start their route, it's important that they compensate for the problems associated with long-distance driving using these two methods.

<em>1. Give Your Spine Support</em>

In a study conducted in the US and Sweden, 50% of frequent drivers reported back pain. Researchers believe this high rate for back pain results from the way driving vibrations interact with the lack of back support in seats.
To counteract this issue, support your lower back. Try the following methods:
• Buy a lumbar support with straps to keep it in place on the seatback.
• Place a roll of paper towels or a rolled-up towel behind your lower back.

<em>2. Change Your Posture</em>

Perpetual slouching, leaning, and tiling increase the tension in your body. This can result in the follow chronic problems:
• Back pain
• Blurred or otherwise compromised vision
• Joint pain
• Neck stiffness
• Tension
Simply changing the way you sit can alleviate or eliminate these problems. Adjust the seat, headrest, and rearview mirror to comfortable positions. You should not have to tilt your head to see the rearview mirror.

<strong>To Deal with Pain</strong>

For drivers who have already begun to feel the effects of sitting in a truck for long periods of time, these simple techniques can help reduce their pain.

<em>3. Use Heat and Ice Therapy</em>

Many kinds of pain result from inflammation. Cold reduces inflammation; applying a cold pack in 20 minute cycles is a good way to prevent complications. For more severe pain, alternate ice and heat therapy.
Bring a cold pack and heating pad on the road with you. Keep cold packs in a cooler so they are ready for when you most need them. Warm up a reusable heating pad in a gas station microwave. Or, for convenience, opt for one-use heating pads or invest in a heated seat pad.

<em>4. Practice Relaxation Techniques</em>

Much of the pain that comes with frequent driving is due to strain from keeping your body in an unnatural position for long periods of time. Consciously relax parts of your body in turn, including your:
• Neck
• Non-working leg
• Shoulders
• Upper arms
Mental relaxation can also help relieve pain. Keep your mind relaxed using the following techniques:
• Develop a regular exercise routine
• Get enough sleep
• Listen to soothing music or nature sounds while driving

<em>5. Maintain Driving Conditions</em>

You probably already have a routine for keeping your cab just the way you like it. Use this habit to reduce your pain in the following ways:
• Choose and maintain a single comfortable temperature. Some tension comes from your muscles adjusting to temperature changes.
• Keep your eye line level as you drive. Adjust your mirrors to force yourself to sit up straight and leave them in those positions.
• When visibility is poor, move your seat forward instead of leaning. This allows you to keep your usual posture.

<em>6. Use Over-the-Counter or Natural Pain Relievers</em>

Truckers should never use prescription medications while driving. Instead, opt for an over-the-counter solution or use one of the following natural remedies:
• Apply natural ointments like Arnica to reduce inflammation. These ointments reduce the pressure on your joints and give your body time to heal.
• Eat foods high in resveratrol like red grapes, cranberries, and blueberries. This chemical blocks the chemicals that cause tissue degeneration, which can keep you feeling healthy.
• Use essential oils like wintergreen, balsam fir, and copaiba. You can take some essential oils orally while you should apply others topically. These natural remedies can counteract inflammation and provide aromatherapy benefits.

If any of your drivers experience chronic or severe pain, encourage them to see a chiropractor, doctor, or physical therapist. The physical effects of driving are better combated if taken on early.
As an owner/operator, you should supply your drivers with the knowledge and tools they need to maintain their health and comfort. Here are some ways you can do that:
• Distribute instructions for relaxation techniques.
• Offer short classes on pain and tension relieving exercises.
• Provide each new driver with a lumbar support or cold packs.
• Encourage your drivers to follow a regular exercise program and healthy sleep schedule.

,,,,,,default_layout,6,,,"Resource Center",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,77,"Whether you're a semi-truck driver or you manage a fleet of trucks, you can save a lot of money by minimizing your fuel costs. Gasoline and diesel costs tend to add up in an industry that requires a lot of pickups, deliveries, and travel time.

Since semi-trucks are so heavy, they aren't the most fuel-efficient vehicles on the market. On average, semi-trucks get only 6.5 miles per gallon. Their efficiency ranges wildly between 3 mpg going up hills to more than 23 mpg going downhill. But even if it were possible to plan entire routes with only downhill roads, that's not the most efficient method of improving fuel efficiency.

<!--more-->

Instead, let’s focus on how drivers can help mitigate fuel costs. Follow these simple tips to save fuel and money at the same time.

<strong>Don't Overfill Your Tank </strong>

When the tank is filled to capacity, it can expand and overflow when the fuel is heated. The sun can heat gain the tank, or fuel can be heated by the engine and cause overflow when it returns to the tank. Overflow is wasteful and dangerous to other drivers on the road. The extra fuel can also add to extra weight, which slows down the vehicle.

<strong>Be Moderate with Braking </strong>

When your truck comes to a complete stop, it requires more fuel to get back up to speed. Although all vehicles should come to a complete stop at stop signs and stoplights and follow all other traffic laws, drivers can use braking techniques to minimize unnecessary complete stops.

<strong>Regulate Your Speed </strong>

When you maintain a constant speed, you maintain a steady fuel usage. When you accelerate, you burn more fuel. If you accelerate more quickly, you burn more fuel. That's why it’s important to maintain a speed at the speed limit. For trucks, the speed limit is usually no higher than 65 mph.

<strong>Regularly Inflate Your Tires </strong>

When your tires are correctly inflated, you improve your fuel efficiency. For every 1 psi drop in pressure that your tires have, your under-inflated tires can lower your gas mileage by .3%. When your tires are inflated, they have a longer lifespan and are safer for the road.

<strong>Stay in a Higher Gear </strong>

Instead of starting and stopping, try speeding up and slowing down incrementally. You'll have to make fewer gear changes to raise and reduce your speed, and higher gears save fuel.

<strong>Avoid Idling Your Truck </strong>

Many drivers leave their trucks idling while they run a quick errand. Or they keep the truck idling to maintain the temperature during a cold or hot day. They may even want to avoid restarting the vehicle. However, you should never let your semi-truck idle for longer than five minutes. One hour of idling will burn a gallon of gas. Turn your truck off if you need to leave it for a while it’s probably the easiest way to save fuel.

<strong>Use Your Momentum </strong>

When you drive a heavy truck, you build a lot of momentum. Even when you drive at a consistent speed, you build momentum that can carry you through a stoplight if you don't break in time. On hills, though, you can use your momentum to your advantage. Collect momentum before going up a hill so you can use the energy to make it to the top of the hill. Once you reach the apex of a hill, you can use your gathered momentum to ride the downhill slope without using your gas pedal. When you approach a stop or exit, start slowing down long before you reach the actual stop. Use your brakes minimally, as they waste your momentum and lower your fuel efficiency.

<strong>Watch Slippery Roads </strong>

It's harder for tires to grip roads when they're slippery from ice, rain, or oil. Even gravel surfaces make accelerating more difficult. Large semis need to accelerate slowly from a stop to avoid accidents and save fuel.

<strong>Fix Your Deflectors </strong>

If your truck has roof-mounted air deflectors, you can adjust them to guide air over the highest part of your trailer. If you have an uneven load height, this should be at the front of the trailer.

<strong>Keep Your Load Height Low </strong>

If your load is unevenly distributed, it can affect how much effort your truck needs to make to get moving. Try to keep your load as low and even as possible to improve the fuel economy.

<strong>Have a Good Driver Attitude </strong>

The most important aspect of maximizing your fuel economy is having a good attitude. When you or your drivers always keep fuel efficiency in mind, you'll be more likely to use these simple techniques to improve your fuel consumption. Even the best plans to improve fuel efficiency are useless if the drivers don't want to implement them.

,,,,,,default_layout,,,,"Resource Center",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,79,"The road can be a dangerous place. No one knows this better than the truckers who spend their waking hours travelling on America's highways. Follow these safety tips to ensure a peaceful, danger-free drive.

<strong>Perform a Pre-Trip Inspection</strong>

<!--more-->

Take fifteen minutes to inspect your truck before every trip and at every rest stop. Make sure your truck complies with all of the federal and state requirements set for your safety.

Walk around the truck and look for any leaks. Check the air pressure on each tire to make sure they are full and ready to go. Inspect your belts and hoses. Check the oil, coolant, and power steering reservoirs. Follow all regulations.

<strong>Take Your Breaks</strong>

Fuel stops make regular breaks necessary. However, some drivers try to make up time by cutting their breaks short. This can lead to drowsiness and fatigue. Don't put yourself at risk by taking shorter breaks than necessary.

Take the time to rest, walk around, and perform light exercise. All of these activities help drivers stay alert and awake.

<strong>Watch the Signs</strong>

After you drive down the same stretch of highway a half a dozen times or more, you might start to operate on auto-pilot and ignore road signs along the way. Take care to watch the road signs - speed limits change, constructions begins and ends, and new warnings might go up.

<strong>Watch for Animals</strong>

Cars aren't the only danger on the road-wandering animals can pose a serious threat as well. Watch for animals like deer as you drive through winding highways. Even stray dogs and cats can make their way onto main roads and perhaps cause you to maneuver your truck differently and more dangerously.

<strong>Exercise Patience</strong>

When delays cause you to get behind schedule, you might start to feel pressure to go faster. When others seem to prevent you from reaching your destination in a timely fashion, it's easy to get frustrated.

Stay calm and exercise patience as you drive along the highway. Don’t tailgate. Give yourself plenty of time to stop. Road rage will cause you to make avoidable mistakes.

<strong>Use Your Headlights</strong>

Headlights aren't just for the dark of night. Whenever something inhibits your ability to see the road in front of you or others' ability to see you, turn on your headlights. This includes the rain, fog, and snow.

<strong>Drive in the Right Lane When Possible</strong>

Your greatest blind spots are along the passenger side of your truck and trailer. If possible, try to drive in the far right lane to avoid sideswipes and related accidents.

If you must switch lanes, make sure to use your blinkers to signal your intentions.

<strong>Maintain Your Truck</strong>

Along with pre-trip inspections, perform regular maintenance on your truck to keep it running smoothly. When you keep up with the little things, you avoid larger, more dangerous and expensive issues later on.

<strong>Wear Your Seatbelt</strong>

Even if you do everything right, there is always a chance that you will get in an accident. A seat belt will prevent you from flying through the windshield. It can save your life and help you keep control of the vehicle.

<strong>Share the Road</strong>

When you're driving a large truck, it's easy to feel like you own the road. After all, who wants to go head-to-head with a semi truck? Remember to extend courtesy to the other drivers. Allow faster traffic to pass you without getting frustrated.

<strong>Watch for Stopped Vehicles</strong>

If you see a stopped vehicle on the side of the road, try to switch lanes to allow them some room. If this isn’t possible, slow down as you pass them.

Pay close attention as they may try to merge with traffic under unsafe conditions. Their mistake doesn't have to put you in danger if you watch out of them.

<strong>Map Your Route</strong>

Never leave without thoroughly mapping out your route. Of course you need to know where you're going, but there are benefits to doing a little more research. Check local weather conditions, traffic laws, and animal activity.

Make yourself aware of all factors that could impact your trip. For instance, backed up traffic in one area could make a longer detour a more efficient choice. If winter weather is a concern, consider a less windy, hill-filled route.

<strong>Create a Safety Kit</strong>

Prepare yourself for various emergencies with a truck safety kit. Regulations require commercial vehicles to carry a secure, charged fire extinguisher and emergency triangles. However you could also benefit from including a small tool kit, a flashlight and replacement lights and fuses. Bring along extra batteries for the flashlight as well.

Consider including a basic first aid kit in your truck. Don't forget emergency supplies like a blanket, extra water, etc. in case you get stranded.

<strong>Watch Your Speed</strong>

Because of your trailer, it already takes you longer to stop than most vehicles on the road. As you increase your speed, you also increase your stopping time. Mind the posted speed limits for trucks, and obey any speed constraints from your trucking company. Make sure there is enough space between you and the vehicle in front of you.

Stay safe as you travel across the country. Follow these safety tips reduce risks and enjoy your journey.",,"2016-06-21 10:00:16",post,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/2016/06/21/top-safety-tips-for-truckers/,publish,1,ATSBlogM,schaiyote@arrowtruck.com,,,top-safety-tips-for-truckers,,,0,0,0,closed,closed,"2017-05-08 18:34:44"

You keep odd hours to minimize your encounters with bad traffic. And while driving from dusk until dawn might help you make the most of your time, it can wreak havoc on your body.

While trucking offers freedom and opportunities to see the country, it limits the time you have to take care of your physical wellbeing. To keep fit and maintain a healthy lifestyle, you need to eat properly and exercise regularly. Listed below are tips and suggestions on how to fit these health necessities into your busy schedule.

<strong>Eat Right</strong>

Getting the right nutrients to keep you fueled is not an easy task when you're one the road. Each region of the country has its own delicious dishes and temptations. But making smart food choices is the first step to physical wellbeing.

<em>Snacking Smart</em>

If fried chicken and cornbread are your go-to snacks, you may need to rethink your meal plan. It's okay to eat between meals, as long as the food you choose is healthy. Before you hit the road, stop at the local supermarket and pick up some healthy alternatives to gas station snacks.

Look for foods that are filling and don't need refrigeration. Consider purchasing:
<ul>
	<li>Apples</li>
	<li>Broccoli</li>
	<li>Bell peppers</li>
	<li>Carrots</li>
	<li>Celery</li>
	<li>Hardboiled eggs</li>
	<li>Unsalted nuts</li>
</ul>
These items are low in calories and high in the essential nutrients that help keep your tank full.

<em>Listen to Your Body</em>

It takes time for your body to realize you've had enough food. The chemicals in your food take about 20 minutes to let your brain know when to stop eating. Schedule enough time for your meals so that you can eat slowly.

<em>Drink Water</em>

Part of eating right is drinking right. If you haven't already, cut out or limit your consumption of juices, sodas, and energy and sports drinks. All these beverages contain large quantities of sugar. The sugars in these drinks can negatively affect the insulin levels in your body.

Replace sugary drinks with water. Try drinking a glass of water at least 10 minutes before each meal. This will trick your brain into feeling fuller faster. You can also sip a glass of water as you eat. This will help you spend the right amount of time eating.

<strong>Exercise Regularly</strong>

Sitting behind the wheel of your rig for 20+ hours a day saps your energy. The last thing you want to do at the end of a long day of hauling is exercise. Even if you did have the energy, finding a gym where you need it is next to impossible. Fortunately, you don't need a gym to stay in shape on the road.

The key to staying fit is keeping your heart rate elevated for at least 15 minutes a day. This can take place while you wait for your cargo, top off your gas, or before you eat. Here are a few tips to keep your heart rate up and those extra pounds down.

<em>Take a Lap</em>

Think about how long it takes you to refuel your rig. As you're filling up, consider taking a lap around the parking lot. Refueling stations are often large enough to accommodate dozens of trucks at one time. A lap around the outskirts of the station may be akin to running a quarter mile.

If a brisk jog doesn't get your blood pumping, mix in a short sprint. Each sprint will help elevate your heart rate. The more laps you do around the lot, the longer your heart rate will stay elevated.

<em>Grab the Weights (or Something Else Heavy)</em>

You don't need heavy weights to maintain muscle. You just need to know how to effectively use the weights you do have. A few dumbbells can go a long way to keeping your arm stoned, your belly flat, and your legs in shape.

But dumbbells aren't the only thing you can use to weight train. Medicine balls and resistance bands take up less space and you can use them for most of the same exercises.

If you don't want to haul these items with you, consider what you already have available in your truck. You can also use tires, spare parts, and other heavy equipment to help you stay in shape.

<em>Use Your Body</em>

When all else fails, you can use your own body weight to strength train. Pushups, sit ups, squats, and jumping jacks are all excellent exercises to keep your heart rate up and your muscles strong.

Staying healthy while on the road doesn't require excessive time. It simply requires consistency. Begin living a healthy lifestyle by making and committing to small choices. As you make these small adjustments to your diet and exercise, you will begin to see large changes.",,"2016-06-21 12:00:19",post,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/2016/06/21/how-to-stay-fit-as-a-trucker/,publish,1,ATSBlogM,schaiyote@arrowtruck.com,,,how-to-stay-fit-as-a-trucker,,,0,0,0,closed,closed,"2017-05-08 18:34:19"
,,,,,,default_layout,2,,,"Resource Center",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,92,"As an owner/operator or a leased-on driver, you know you need to work hard to protect yourself and your trucks while driving and keep other drivers on the road safe. All D.O.T certified drivers have passed safety training courses to obtain their CDL licenses, and you have complete faith in your fellow drivers to drive safely.

<!--more-->

However, you also know that unexpected poor weather can test even the best drivers. For instance, in April 2015, sudden high winds in Utah and Nevada stopped freeway traffic for hours after toppling three semi-trucks and causing a 17-car pileup. In Wyoming, the same high winds brought a severe snowstorm that closed the freeway for 20 hours after 50 cars and dozens of semi-trucks crashed.

Since extreme weather can happen anytime and anywhere, drivers need to be prepared to navigate the worst weather. Read below for basic safety tips on how to drive in wind, rain, and snow and pass these tips along to other truck drivers.

<strong>General Safety Tips</strong>

Some safety tips apply to all weather conditions, any time of the year. Ensure that that you follow these basic precautions no matter the season.

<em>Check the Weather Well in Advance</em>

While the weather often changes with little warning, groups like the National Weather Service do their best to stay on top of weather changes and issue severe weather alerts. Download the NWS app (http://mobile.weather.gov/#typeLocation) or any of a number of weather apps to get real-time weather updates in any area.

<em>Obey the Law</em>

It might be tempting to break the speed limit, drive in the left lanes, or drive after only a few hours of sleep, but you should avoid these behaviors at all costs. Drivers should always wear a seatbelt and keep both hands on the wheel. Following the law will keep you and others safe in both typical and extreme weather conditions.

<em>Maintain Trucks</em>

When you purchase a high-quality used vehicle and take good care of it, it will take care of you as well. Paying a little extra to get good vehicles in good condition will return safety dividends in the long run. Practice preventative maintenance and keep your truck in good shape.

<em>Increase Follow Distance and Decrease Speed</em>

High winds, rain, and snow all decrease driver visibility, which makes staying further behind cars more important than ever. Rain and snow also increase the amount of time trucks need to stop. As soon as the weather worsens, slow down and follow further behind.

<em>Prepare an Emergency Kit</em>

Drivers should keep emergency kits with food, water, extra fuel, a cell phone and charger, first aid kit, and a warm blanket in the cab.

<strong>Wind Safety</strong>

Because of their height, semi-trucks have a much harder time staying upright in strong winds than cars or pickups. Remember this key safety tips to avoid a fall in high winds.

<em>Know How Much Weight Is in the Trailer</em>

Drivers already know to pay attention to their trailer’s load. However, in high winds, the trailer’s load and weight become even more crucial to the truck’s stability. You should never attempt to take light or empty trailers through windy conditions.

<em>Balance the Load</em>

Even if the truck has a full trailer, the wind can still push it around if the truck has a high center of gravity or the load becomes unbalanced. The driver should be aware of how likely the trailer’s contents are to shift and how high the truck’s center of gravity is. If the truck is too high to endure strong winds, stay off the road.

<em>Keep Both Hands on the Wheel</em>

Wind can jerk the truck’s control out of your driver's hands. In high wind, both hands need to stay on the wheel at all times for maximum control.

<strong>Snow Safety</strong>

<em>Add Chains</em>

If the weather becomes too snowy or icy, the truck will likely need chains. You should have the right size and amount of chains on hand. Make sure to keep a flashlight, kneeling pad, waterproof gloves, and a reflective vest in the cab to make the chaining process as easy and safe as possible.

<em>Add Anti-Gel</em>

At low temperatures, diesel fuel gets slushy. Add anti-gel to the tank before you fuel up. The nearest auto shop might not have any in stock, especially if the below-freezing temperatures are unseasonable, so make sure you purchase some and keep it on-hand for sudden cold spells.

<strong>Rain Safety</strong>

<em>Beware of Hydroplaning</em>

Hydroplaning occurs when a truck hits a slick patch of rain at high speeds. To minimize hydroplaning effects, drivers should slow down, turn on the headlights to increase visibility, and create a large space between their truck and other cars.

<em>Be Aware in Fog</em>

Fog occasionally accompanies rain. To drive safely in fog, stay alert and engage the fog lights and low-beam headlights. Never use high-beam headlights in fog. Defrost the windshields, follow the taillights of the car just ahead, and clean the lights before getting on a foggy road.

With these safety tips in mind, you are sure to have long, happy and safe travels. Visit your truck dealership to find a used truck that keeps your driver safe in any weather!

And according to DOT regulations, all truck drivers are required to receive a physical and carry a medical card with them each time they start a haul.

<!--more-->

This physical needs to be provided by a licensed medical examiner. You can find a list of providers in your area by searching <a href=""https://nationalregistry.fmcsa.dot.gov/NRPublicUI/Drivers.seam"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) National Registry</a>.

But what happens when you find an examiner and schedule your physical? What can you expect to happen during the exam, and how can you prepare for it? Below, we provide answers to these questions so you learn everything you need to know about this required physical. Read on to discover just how crucial this exam is to your career as a truck driver.

<strong>How to Prepare for Your Physical</strong>

Like any medical exam, you should prepare for your physical before you actually meet with the medical examiner. To prepare for your physical, use the following tips:
<ul>
 	<li>Wear loose clothes.</li>
 	<li>Take your prescription medication as usual.</li>
 	<li>Avoid using the restroom before the physical. You'll give a urine sample that the doctors will use for a kidney screening.</li>
 	<li>Bring a valid driver's license.</li>
 	<li>Make a list of current medications you're taking to give to the examiner.</li>
 	<li>Wear corrective lenses if you have them. Bring a copy of your most recent eye exam report if possible.</li>
</ul>
If you suffer from any medical conditions or illnesses or recently had surgery, you must also bring a <a href=""http://dotphysicaldoctor.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/PCP-Medical-Release-2.0.pdf"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Medical Release Opinion Form</a> with you. The doctor who treated (or is treating) you for these health conditions must sign the form. The medical examiner will then use this information to legally review your medical information.

If you don't provide this information to the medical examiner, he or she may temporarily disqualify you for a medical certificate. As a result, you might not be able to get your commercial driver's license as soon as you hoped.

You also need to bring a printed copy of the MEDICAL EXAM REPORT for the medical examiner to fill out. Before your appointment, you must complete the first two sections with your personal information and medical history.

<strong>What the Medical Examiner Checks</strong>

The medical examiner will do the following during your physical:
<ul>
 	<li>Test your vision.</li>
 	<li>Check your blood pressure.</li>
 	<li>Check your pulse.</li>
 	<li>Listen to your lungs and heart.</li>
 	<li>Look at your ears, mouth, throat, and eyes.</li>
 	<li>Perform a hernia check.</li>
 	<li>Feel and examine your spine for deformities.</li>
 	<li>Press gently on your abdomen and check it for abnormalities.</li>
 	<li>Observe your overall appearance.</li>
</ul>
And, as previously mentioned, you'll submit a urine sample so the examiner can run a kidney analysis. The examiner may also use this sample to conduct a drug test. However, a drug screening is often done separately from the physical.

As your examiner completes each step of the physical, he or she will make note of his or her findings on the exam report. After this brief exam, you and the examiner will then discuss your medical history, current medical conditions and illnesses, and any hazards these conditions create for you as a truck driver.

If you completely meet the DOT's and FMCSA's requirements, you'll receive your medical certificate. This certificate is valid for two years. Depending on the examiner's findings, however, you may be approved for a certificate that is valid for a year or less.

<strong>How You Can Maintain Your Health While on the Road</strong>

Once you have your medical certificate, you should be eligible to receive your commercial driver's license. Though these licenses are valid for several years, you'll have to receive multiple physicals during that time to maintain it.

Follow your medical care provider's instructions to maintain good overall health. As you drive across the state or country, use the following tips to maintain good health and increase your chances of being approved for additional medical certificates in the future:
<ul>
 	<li>Limit the amount of caffeine you drink to maintain low blood pressure.</li>
 	<li>Limit your sugar intake.</li>
 	<li>Quit using nicotine and tobacco products.</li>
 	<li>Take time to stretch and meditate during long hauls.</li>
 	<li>Get plenty of sleep.</li>
 	<li>Eat healthy foods, such as potassium-rich fruits and vegetables.</li>
</ul>
You should also invest in products like back rests and seat pillows to properly support your body as you sit in your seat.

<strong>Final Words of Advice</strong>

Use the information in this blog to prepare for your upcoming physical. Work closely with your health care provider and your FMCSA and DOT approved medical examiner to make any necessary changes to your health and lifestyle. Adhere to those guidelines so you can pass your physical and receive your commercial driver's license.

<p style=""color: #575555;"">How much tampering with exhaust emissions equipment goes on out there? No one knows for sure, but panelists at a session of the Technology &amp; Maintenance Council's fall meeting in Pittsburgh last week said they had seen some flagrant cases.</p>
 <!--more-->
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Tampering attempts have become more desperate and damaging since 2002, when exhaust-gas recirculation equipment first appeared on diesels, and 2007, when particulate filters were required.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Tampering attempts have become more desperate and damaging since 2002, when exhaust-gas recirculation equipment first appeared on diesels, and 2007, when particulate filters were required.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Tampering is anything that takes a vehicle out of its original government-certified state. It's been going on with truck diesels since there were government emissions standards. Simple sneakiness has included leaving the elements out of air filter canisters and turning up mechanical fuel pumps.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">But the attempts have become more desperate and damaging since diesels became highly complex starting in 2002, when exhaust-gas recirculation equipment first appeared on diesels, and 2007, when particulate filters were required, said people on the panel. Some examples:</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>Blocking or restricting EGR plumbing; removing catalysts from chambers in the exhaust system; and doing electronic modifications to make a sensor think diesel exhaust fluid is present when it's not.</strong></p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Often such mods will damage pistons, rings, cylinder walls, injectors, and other internal parts because they introduce too much fuel and heat. But ""today's sensors can pick up most of these,"" said Bill Puchniarz, manager, engine support and improvement, at Navistar International.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>Drilling holes in substrates of diesel particulate filters to make exhaust gases flow more freely through the honeycomb structures.</strong></p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">This defeats the purpose of the DPF, which is to remove soot from the exhaust, and affects reliability of the devices, noted Kevin Otto, service director for Cummins Emissions Solutions. And it probably voids the warranty on an engine and its aftertreatment systems, because warranties expressly forbid ""unauthorized modifications.""</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Moreover, ""there are frequently short- and long-term unintended consequences,"" he said. Changing one or more components can upset a careful balance between performance and emissions reduction. He has seen DPF substrates that were cracked and even melting because of changes upstream. The melting point of the ceramic material is 1,400 degrees C (about 2,500 F), compared to 600 degrees C (about 1,100 F) when exhaust leaves the engine.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>Disconnecting the exhaust pipe from the DPF to completely avoid it.</strong></p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">In one case found by the federal Environmental Protection Agency, someone had cut into the pipe ahead of the DPF, and gases were exiting the system under the cab, said Anne Wick, diesel engine consent decree coordinator for the agency. The driver breathed in carbon monoxide and fell ill, and had to go to a hospital; doctors found CO in his blood.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Wick listed ailments attributed to diesel exhaust, especially its particulate matter, ranging from irritated eyes to asthma and other internal damage to lungs and passages in the nose and throat. These are the reasons engines face limits on exhaust emissions, she said.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>Facing the Consequences</strong></p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">How prevalent is tampering? No one can know for sure, but the Environmental Protection Agency does a lot of equipment evaluations to find evidence of tampering ""to keep a level playing field for the industry,"" said Bob Klepp, chief of air quality enforcement. ""We have found that some fleets have 50% of their vehicles tampered with, and we follow up with enforcement.""</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Penalties under federal law are $37,500 per violation for a dealer or manufacturer and $3,750 for an individual. A court can order that the offending engine be set back to where it is. EPA does a lot of calculating to arrive at a penalty that's reasonable, Klepp said.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Examples include the landmark 1998 case where most American heavy truck and engine builders signed a consent decree with EPA admitting that they set electronic controls to pass emissions tests, then programmed them to reset to less stringent ""defeat"" settings during highway running. The penalty totaled $83 million among the builders, and they had to begin installing EGR gear in October 2002, 15 months before the original deadline for the equipment.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Lesser-known and more recent examples include:</p>

<ul style=""color: #575555;"">
 	<li>A $500,000 payment by Edge Products for selling devices that lessened the performance of DPFs on diesel pickups.</li>
 	<li>Suzuki Motors paid a $885,000 fine for using a dual mapping system on its cars for highway and city.</li>
 	<li>Casper's Electronics, a small aftermarket firm, sold ""oxygen sensor simulators"" that degraded exhaust quality, and EPA fined it a modest $80,000 ""because there was a demonstrated inability to pay more,"" Klepp said.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">This doesn't mean that aftermarket devices are necessarily illegal, he said. Use of a non-original-equipment engine part is not tampering if it can be demonstrated that it doesn't adversely affect emissions. A non-original engine change is also allowed if there are no adverse effects to emissions. These so-called safe harbors go back to 1974 and EPA's Memo 1A, which set the policy.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Enforcement by various states, most notably California and certain others in the Northeast which use California standards, is done during roadside inspections or periodic equipment checks, said the EPA's Wick. Four states allow self-verification by fleet owners.</p>

<ul style=""color: #575555;"">
 	<li>To meet EPA '07 levels for particulate matter, all manufacturers turned to an exhaust after-treatment system</li>
 	<li>The technology in this after-treatment system is the<strong> ""Diesel Particulate Filter"".</strong></li>
 	<li>Instead of exhausting soot into the atmosphere, the DPF traps the soot, and then uses heat to oxidize it. So what exits the exhaust is much cleaner air.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">HOW DOES IT WORK</span></strong></p>

<ul style=""color: #575555;"">
 	<li>The DPF is actually a <strong>ceramic filter</strong> that has thousands of tiny channels. As the exhaust passes through these channels, soot is trapped along the channel walls and is prevented from exhausting through the stacks.</li>
 	<li>The ceramic filter looks like a <strong>honeycomb structure.</strong></li>
 	<li>This structure is covered with a layer of chemical catalyst that contains small amounts of precious metal, usually <strong>platinum</strong> or <strong>palladium</strong>, that interact with and oxidize pollutants in the exhaust stream (CO and unburned HCs), thereby reducing poisonous emissions.</li>
 	<li>Soot trapped along the channel walls prevent it from exhausting through the stacks.</li>
 	<li>Every once in a while, the DPF must remove the soot that has built up along the channel walls to remain effective.</li>
 	<li>This process is called <strong>""Regeneration.""</strong></li>
 	<li>Regeneration is an <strong>oxidation process</strong> that uses heat to remove the soot from the filter.</li>
 	<li>The regeneration process is actually pretty simple.</li>
 	<li>There are two stages in this process: 1) <strong>ACTIVE &amp; 2) PASSIVE</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">PASSIVE REGENERATION</span></strong></p>

<ul style=""color: #575555;"">
 	<li>Passive regeneration <strong>occurs naturally</strong> under steady driving, when the engine achieves the required operating temperature.</li>
 	<li>The DPF contains an oxidation catalyst that is coated with precious metals.</li>
 	<li>Under normal highway driving, passive regeneration takes place as the catalyst in the DPF heats up enough to oxidize the soot and turn it into CO2.</li>
 	<li>The CO2 exits through the exhaust stack.</li>
 	<li>Any residues left behind are converted into harmless ash that collects in the DPF canister.</li>
 	<li><strong>The process is continual,</strong> so whenever the vehicle reaches operating temperature, the DPF will begin passive regeneration.</li>
 	<li>Passive regeneration occurs naturally under steady high engine loads.</li>
 	<li>Catalyst in DPF oxidizes soot when exhaust temperatures reach about 600° F</li>
</ul>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">ACTIVE REGENERATION</span></strong></p>

<ul style=""color: #575555;"">
 	<li>Over time, passive regeneration is not enough to prevent soot from building up in the DPF and that's when the second stage of cleaning is used. This is called<strong> ""Active Regeneration.""</strong></li>
 	<li>The truck engine computer indicates that the DPF needs cleaning, and if the operating temperature is high enough, it<strong> automatically</strong> initiates an active regeneration.</li>
 	<li>In general, active regeneration begins when a small amount of fuel is introduced into the exhaust stream between the turbocharger and the DPF.</li>
 	<li>This fuel is atomized into an extremely fine spray that does not burn. Instead, when it makes contact with the catalyst on the DPF, it generates intense heat -upwards of 1100 degrees Fahrenheit --that oxidizes any remaining soot on the ceramic filter.</li>
 	<li>Again, the soot is oxidized and CO2 exits the stacks and ash collects in the canister.</li>
 	<li>Small amount of fuel is introduced into the exhaust stream to create intense heat - upwards of 1100 degrees Fahrenheit - to oxidize any remaining soot.</li>
 	<li>Active Regeneration <strong>may take place once a day</strong>, depending on the type of driving.</li>
 	<li>Each regeneration <strong>can take 30 minutes or more</strong>.</li>
 	<li>If you stop or slow down, the regeneration <strong>may be interrupted</strong> and <strong>may need to repeat.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">AUTOMATIC REGENERATION</span></strong></p>

<ul style=""color: #575555;"">
 	<li>In general, after treatment systems are <strong>self-monitoring</strong>. When the soot level is high enough, the system automatically initiates an active regeneration.</li>
 	<li>Vehicle idle speed may increase when stopped to maintain proper regeneration conditions.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">PARKED REGENERATIONS</span></strong></p>

<ul style=""color: #575555;"">
 	<li>There will be times when drivers will need to perform a <strong>manual</strong> or ""<strong>parked</strong>"" regeneration. This may be because they cancelled a regen, or an automatic regen had started, but was interrupted when the vehicle was stopped.</li>
 	<li>Parked regens are active regenerations <strong>initiated by the driver</strong> when the vehicle is stopped, engine running, with the parking brake applied. Usually there is a dash switch of software based method for initiating a parked regen</li>
 	<li><strong>Cautions</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Extremely high exhaust temperature during active regeneration.</li>

<h4><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></h4>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">The two compounds in diesel exhaust that have the most impact on the environment are NOx and particulate matter, which is more commonly called ""Soot"".</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">NOx, or Nitrogen oxides, is the generic term for a group of highly reactive gases, all of which contain nitrogen and oxygen in varying amounts. Many of the nitrogen oxides are colorless and odorless. However, one common pollutant, nitrogen dioxide along with particles in the air can often be seen as a reddish-brown layer over many urban areas.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><!--more--></p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Soot, is the visible exhaust - the black smoke you see coming from the stacks. It's made up of unburned fuel, carbon, and other solid material.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Beginning January 2007, the Environmental Protection Agency put into placenew emission requirements for all diesel engines. These strict regulations greatly reduce diesel emissions. Actually, from 1990 to 2007, the EPA has progressively reduced allowable NOx levels in diesel exhaust a total of 80%.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Today, with the 2007 regulations, the EPA has reduced allowable particulate matter in diesel exhaust a total of 90%. And the difference is not just what you see on the highways, but it's also in much cleaner air and a healthier environment.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">To meet the EPA 2007 levels for particulate matter, all manufacturers turned to an <strong>Exhaust After-Treatment System. </strong>Beginning 2007, Exhaust Aftertreatment System (ATS) are on every diesel truck sold in US and Canada</p>

<h4><strong>DIESEL PARTICULATE FILTERS (DPF)</strong></h4>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>Question: </strong>
• What do I need to know?</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>Answer: </strong>
• For the most part, they will take care of themselves.
• You do have some control.</p>

<h4><strong>ABOUT DPFs</strong></h4>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">The technology in this <strong>After-Treatment System </strong>is the <strong>Diesel Particulate Filter</strong>. You'll also hear it referred to simply as the <strong>DPF</strong>. The DPF replaces the old muffler and traps.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Instead of exhausting soot into the atmosphere, the DPF traps the soot, and then uses heat to oxidize it. So what exits the exhaust is much cleaner air. The soot is periodically regenerated into clean, carbon dioxide gas and water vapor. The resulting xhaust is clean - no odor or diesel smell. This cleaner exhaust won't blacken your trailer, and won't even blacken inside of exhaust stack!</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>Here's How It Works.</strong></p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">The DPF is actually a ceramic filter that has thousands of tiny channels. DPF collects soot (particulate matter) created by engine.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">As the exhaust passes through these channels, soot is trapped along the channel walls and is prevented from exhausting through the stacks, which also protects the environment. Solid matter is trapped...</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Periodically, the DPF must remove the soot that has built up along the channel walls. This is called ""regeneration."" It's like a - like a self-cleaning oven
Regeneration is an oxidation process that uses heat to remove the soot from the filter. The regeneration process is actually pretty simple. There are really only two stages: Passive and Active.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>There Are Really Only Two Stages Of After-Treatment:</strong></p>

<ul style=""color: #575555;"">
 	<li><strong>1. Passive</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>2. Active</strong></li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>""PASSIVE"" REGENERATION</strong></h4>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Passive regeneration occurs naturally under steady driving, when the engine achieves the required operating temperature. The DPF contains an oxidation catalyst that is coated with precious metals. Under normal highway driving, passive regeneration takes place as the catalyst in the DPF heats up enough to oxidize the soot and turn it into C-O-two. The C-O-two exits through the exhaust stack. Any residues left behind are converted into harmless ash that collects in the DPF canister.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">The process is continual, so whenever the vehicle reaches operating temperature, the DPF will begin passive regeneration. This means you don't have to do anything to make passive regeneration happen, and you won't notice any differences in how the vehicle operates. In fact, passive regeneration is happening all the time, and you'll never know it!</p>

<h4><strong>""ACTIVE"" REGENERATION</strong></h4>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Over time, passive regeneration is not enough to prevent soot from building up in the DPF. And that's when the second stage of cleaning is used. This is called ""active regeneration."" When your engine's computer indicates that the DPF needs cleaning, and if the operating temperature is high enough, it automatically initiates an active regeneration. The system will typically initiate an active regeneration by itself. Youmay be unaware that there is an active regen in progress.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Active regeneration begins when a small amount of fuel is introduced into the exhaust stream between the turbocharger and the DPF. This fuel is atomized into an extremely fine spray that does not burn. Instead, when it makes contact with the catalyst on the DPF, it generates intense heat - upwards of 1100 degrees Fahrenheit -- that oxidizes any remaining soot on the ceramic filter.C-O-two exits the stacks and ash collects in the canister.</p>

<h4><strong>""ACTIVE"" REGENERATION - HOW OFTEN? </strong></h4>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Depending on your driving, active regeneration may happen as often as once a day. If you do a lot of stop and go, it can happen even more often. Frequency depends on duty cycle and how much soot collects - as often as once a day or every other day An active regeneration could take up to one-half hour or more.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">If you slow down or stop the vehicle after an active regeneration has started, it may be interrupted and might have to start again. So don't be concerned if the dash indicates that another regeneration is in progress.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Periodically, the DPF will need to be serviced with a professional cleaning to remove the ash that has collected in the canister. This can take as little as 30 minutes.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong class=""note"" style=""color: #ff0000;"">MORE STOPS = MORE FREQUENT ACTIVE REGEN'S.</strong></p>

<h4><strong>""ACTIVE"" REGENERATION - WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING? </strong></h4>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">During active regeneration, fuel is introduced which can raise temperatures in the exhaust stream to help regeneration. This can take 20-60 minutes and may consume Â½ gallon of fuel. A slight whistling is normal.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong style=""color: #339966;"">THE REGEN TEMPERATURE IS ROUGHLY EQUAL TO EXHAUST SYSTEM
TEMPERATURES ON A LONG HARD PULL. </strong></p>

<h4><strong>""ACTIVE"" REGENERATION - WHEN, WHERE, HOW? </strong></h4>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">The truck can regen all by itself ONLY while moving. If the driver slows or stops the truck, the regen will stop. If a regen is needed while stopped, the driver or a technician must initiate a parked regen.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong class=""note"" style=""color: #ff0000;"">A PARKED TRUCK CAN'T REGEN BY ITSELF
WITHOUT DRIVER INTERVENTION. </strong></p>

<h4><strong>""ACTIVE"" REGENERATION - HOW WILL YOU KNOW? </strong></h4>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">You'll see this message in the Driver Information Display: ""Regen In Progress""</p>

<h4><strong>""ACTIVE"" REGENERATION - WHAT DO YOU NEED TO DO? </strong></h4>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Usually, nothing. The vehicle needs to run at operating temperature during the regeneration, so highway driving is best. Just drive as you normally would.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">During active regeneration, the exhaust outlet temperature is extremely high. So watch your location if regeneration is about to begin. If you are entering a location where high exhaust temperatures might be unsafe - a crowded work site, a fueling station or a tunnel, etc. - you should cancel the regen.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>Here's how:</strong></p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Press enter on the DID control stalk to disable regeneration until you are returning to the highway and can enable regen again. Or wait until you're stopped in a safe location where you can perform a ""parked"" or ""manual"" regeneration.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">The High Exhaust System Temperature indicator illuminates during active regeneration when the vehicle is stopped or moving at less than 5 miles per hour. This is to remind you to be aware of your surroundings during an active regeneration when the vehicle is stopped or moving slowly.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">If an automatic regeneration is stopped, the Request Regeneration Icon will stay illuminated and the message ""Manual REGEN Required"" will display in the Driver Information Display.</p>

<h4><strong>""ACTIVE"" REGENERATION - WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU SLOW DOWN? </strong></h4>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">A tell-tale yellow lamp may come on if the vehicle slows down below 5 mph after operating on the highway and accumulating heat in the DPF. This means ""HIGH EXHAUST TEMPERATURE."" It does NOT indicate that there is anything wrong. The lamp will turn off after the temperature is back to normal level or if vehicle speed &gt; 10 mph.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>When parking the vehicle and the lamp is on, you should:</strong></p>
<p class=""note"" style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>KEEP THE VEHICLE AWAY FROM PEOPLE,
FLAMMABLE MATERIALS, VAPORS, STRUCTURES.</strong></p>

<h4><strong>DISABLING REGENERATION </strong></h4>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">You may want to disable regeneration if the truck will be soon be in a location where high exhaust system temperature is undesirable (parking indoors to unload).</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">If regeneration is already underway and you find yourself in a hazardous location, you can cancel the regen.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>Here's how: </strong></p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">To disable regeneration, navigate using the Driver Information Display menu and the right-hand stalk controls,
<strong>1. </strong>Use the controls to scroll to <strong>Aftertreatment</strong>.
<strong>2. </strong>Press ENTER.
<strong>3. </strong>Scroll to <strong>Cancel REGEN</strong>. Press ENTER.
<strong>4. </strong>Scroll to <strong>Disable REGEN</strong>.Press ENTER. The Disable REGEN box will be checked.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Using the Driver Information Display menu and the right-hand stalk controls, scroll down to the after-treatment menu. Select ""Cancel REGEN"" and then select ""Disable REGEN."" This will prevent any regeneration from happening until you ENABLE it again.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">When regeneration is disabled, the letters ATS with an X through them will be displayed in the Information display. This means that you are preventing regeneration from taking place - and if this goes on long enough, you will shut down the vehicle.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">So as soon as possible, enable regeneration by returning to the after-treatment menu, select CANCEL REGEN, and then choose ENABLE REGENERATION.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">You'll see the X in the enable regeneration box, and the ATS symbol with the line through it will disappear from your display.</p>

<h4><span class=""note"" style=""color: #ff0000;"">DISABLING REGENERATION - IMPORTANT!</span></h4>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">If the Regen has been disabled, the Driver Information Display shows an ""X"" through ATS (AfterTreatment System) on the bottom row.</p>

<h4><strong class=""note"" style=""color: #ff0000;"">IMPORTANT:
RE-ENABLE REGEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
IF YOU DON'T, YOU MIGHT DISABLE THE TRUCK
AND IT WILL NEED TO BE TOWED. </strong></h4>
<h4><strong>ENABLING REGENERATION</strong></h4>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>1. </strong>Scroll to <strong>Cancel REGEN</strong>. Press ENTER.
<strong>2. </strong>Scroll to <strong>Enable REGEN</strong>. Press ENTER. The Enable REGEN box will be checked.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>When regen is enabled, the ATS icon will no longer appear in the display. </strong></p>

<h4><strong>WHEN REGENERATION IS NEEDED </strong></h4>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">The solid amber DPF Regeneration request indicator on the instrument panel indicates that the DPF is becoming full. This is the normal operation status for the DPF.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">You'll see ""REGEN In Process, Enter to Delay"" displayed in the DID. Proceed with normal operation for an automatic regeneration, or press enter on the DID control stalk to disable the regeneration until you can stop at a safe location to perform a ""parked"" regeneration, or you can enable regeneration again once you're getting back on the highway.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>IF... </strong>
<strong>1) </strong>The truck has been operated too long with regen disabled, or
<strong>2) </strong>If the DPF needs cleaning</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">You'll see this yellow warning light in the lower left-hand corner of the dash.
If the truck has been operated with insufficient opportunities for regen, or if regen has been disabled and the system becomes full, another yellow warning light will illuminate.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">This symbol depicts a filter and the exhaust stream and indicates operator intervention is needed.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>WHEN YOU SEE THIS LAMP YOU HAVE 3 OPTIONS: </strong>
<strong>1) </strong>Drive at uninterrupted highway speeds for a while and make sure <strong class=""note"" style=""color: #ff0000;"">Regen is enabled</strong>.
<strong>2) </strong>Before the end of the day, <span class=""note"" style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>perform a <em>Parked Regen</em></strong></span>. (Requires that the vehicle is programmed to allow this option).
<strong>3) </strong>Before the end of the day, <span class=""note"" style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>let a technician perform a <em>Parked Regen</em></strong></span><strong><em>. </em></strong></p>

<h4><strong>WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DO NOTHING?</strong></h4>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">If you operate the truck without taking action, the yellow ""Regen Needed"" icon will begin to flash.</p>
&nbsp;
<p style=""color: #575555;"">If you continue to operate the truck without taking action, the YELLOW ""CHECK"" light will illuminate.</p>
&nbsp;
<p style=""color: #575555;"">If you still continue to operate the truck without taking action, the ""STOP ENGINE"" light will illuminate. The engine may shut down. A technician will then need to regenerate the filter.</p>
&nbsp;
<p style=""color: #575555;"">If the amber DPF Regeneration Request light is flashing the DPF is full. The DPF may have reached this status from being disabled for too long. You should stop the vehicle in a safe location when you can and perform a parked regeneration.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">A flashing amber Regeneration Request indicator, combined with the amber Check light, is telling you that the DPF is over full and engine performance is reduced. This can happen if you have disabled regen and fail to enable it again.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">At this point, an automatic regeneration is not possible. You will need to pull over immediately and perform a parked regeneration or take the vehicle to an authorized Volvo service center.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">A flashing Regeneration Request indicator in combination with the Stop light means the soot level in the DPF is critically high and a serious engine or DPF problem has occurred. This can happen if you have disregarded earlier warnings and continued to operate the vehicle with regen disabled.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">At this point, the vehicle will be in shut-down mode, and the engine will be significantly de-rated. When this happens, you must stop the vehicle as soon as it is safe to pull over. You will not be able to drive the vehicle until it is serviced by an authorized Volvo technician.</p>
<p class=""note"" style=""color: #ff0000;""><strong>USUALLY OCCURS ONLY IF THE DRIVER IGNORES THE
WARNINGS FOR HOURS, OR SOMETIMES DAYS.</strong></p>

<h4></h4>
<h4><strong>PERFORMING A PARKED REGEN </strong></h4>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">There will be times that you'll need to perform a manual or ""parked"" regeneration. This may be because you cancelled a regen, or an automatic regen had started, but was interrupted when you stopped the vehicle.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">To perform a parked regen, make sure the vehicle is stopped, engine running, with the parking brake applied
Park the vehicle away from people, or any flammable materials, vapors, or structures.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">• Using the stalk controls and the DID, select:
• Aftertreatment (ENTER)
• Request parked REGEN (ENTER)</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">• Always refer to the operator's manual.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">• Note: a parked regen will consume about twice as much fuel as an active regen while moving.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Remember never to perform a manual or ""parked"" regeneration where people or combustible items may be near the exhaust outlet. Do not perform a parked regen when you're in a fuel depots, inside a warehouse or other buildings, near low-hanging branches, and so on.</p>

<h4><strong>A FEW MORE THINGS TO REMEMBER ...</strong></h4>
<h4><strong>ULTRA LOW SULFUR DIESEL</strong></h4>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">• To comply with federal regulations, you must fill trucks ONLY with the new emission systems at diesel pumps labeled, ""ULTRA LOW SULFUR DIESEL.""</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">• Widely available since October 2006.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">• Only 15 parts per million sulfur.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">• Prevents fouling of the DPF.</p>

<h4><strong>NEW ENGINE OIL</strong></h4>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">• The oil industry has developed an improved oil specification for the new 2007 engines.
• Volvo recommends use of oils meeting Volvo VDS-4 (API CJ-4) specification on new and older Volvo diesel engines.
• This replaces the API CI-4 specification. VDS-4 has lower ash, sulfur, and phosphorous content.
• Improved wear protection
• Deposit / oil consumption control
• Soot-related viscosity control
• Prevention of viscosity loss from shearing
• Used oil low-temperature pumpability
• Oil protection from thermal and oxidative breakdown</p>

<h4><strong>PERFORMANCE</strong></h4>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">• Drivers who've driven engines equipped with Volvo's new emission engines with diesel particulate filters say they perform better than ever.
• Cruise rpm is 1300-1500 rpm on Volvo engines.
• Peak torque is available at 1100 rpm.
• The engines are more responsive with sudden applications of throttle.</p>

,,,,,,default_layout,1,,,"Financing and Money Matters|Resource Center",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,134,"<p style=""color: #575555;"">Escrow accounts have always been a hot button for owner-operators. Carriers' negligence in disclosing items escrow money was intended to pay for has led to disputes upon lease termination. Occasional lawsuits challenged carrier practices, sometimes with positive outcomes for the owner-operators.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><!--more--></p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">One result has been more fair and consistent escrow practices. Another outcome is that carriers have been more willing to establish voluntary financial relationships with owner-operators to facilitate savings for maintenance, taxes and other large bills that can handicap a budding trucking business.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Under federal law, however, any fund held by an owner-operator in cooperation with an interstate carrier is governed by the escrow regulations in leasing. Full disclosure of all items secured in the escrow is the carrier's responsibility. It's incumbent on the owner-operator to know what he or she is getting into before signing the lease.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Security escrows</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Independent owner-operator Robert Harsell's experience with the most common type of escrow account, the security escrow (or bond), is common. About seven years ago, the Virginia-based owner-operator was leased to a company with a hefty $3,500 escrow requirement, he says, ""which they dropped to $2,500."" Its main purpose was to pay any cargo insurance claim deductible. ""I got my money back when I left the company,"" he says.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Escrows of this size are the exception unless you're leasing the truck or in a lease-purchase situation. For instance, the much smaller $700 escrow required of Dart Transit contractors acts ""as a sort of guarantee for contractor advances, various expenses and other things"" the carrier takes on, says Steve Gundale, company spokesman. At Mercer Transportation, an initial $350 covers base plates for contractors. ""When they terminate the lease, we give the money back,"" says company Controller Tim Pike.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Problems arise, says Sheri Aaberg of leasing company ATBS Leaseco, when the carrier fails to adequately communicate the escrow account's purpose. The sudden appearance of ""miscellaneous"" or ""unspecified"" escrow deductions on settlements often leads to a sour end to the lease - if not legal action.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">When a trucker enters into a lease-purchase arrangement facilitated by ATBS Leaseco, Aaberg says, ""we're very careful about sitting down and going through all of it with them.""</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">One area to watch, says CRST Malone Vice President Bill Trotter, is a requirement for advance notice of contract termination for return of escrow monies. While Malone doesn't require a certain time period for its owner-operators to get escrow money back, Trotter says he's seen 30-day notification periods elsewhere. Some carriers operate on simple trust when leasing owner-operators. ""Just before I got my authority,"" says owner-operator Harsell, ""I was about to lease on to another company. They did not have an escrow requirement.""</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Lease-purchase maintenance escrows</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">CRST Malone's lease-purchase operators, similar to those in other lease-purchase arrangements, are required to have a $1,500 initial security escrow. Along with that is a maintenance contract and additional maintenance escrow ""that will cover most everything that goes wrong with the truck,"" Trotter says.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Maintenance escrow accounts in lease-purchase situations are typically mandatory, often funded from settlements on a per-mile basis to account for variability in weekly mileage.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">These escrows are meant to protect both the carrier's and the owner-operator's investments in the truck. Lease-purchase operators must abide by the maintenance contract; if they don't, the carrier can use the maintenance escrow to ""help"" them abide.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Jeremia Soriano, leased to Am-Can Transport (now part of the Greatwide companies) with his wife as team driver of a 2003 Freightliner Columbia, has only a couple months left in his lease period. After making a balloon payment of about $8,000 on the remaining value, he will own it.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Working with ATBS Leaseco for financing, Soriano says his weekly settlement shows a lump sum deduction of $225 that is placed in his maintenance escrow. For a solo driver, it's $125, he says.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Though some might view it as just another payment, Soriano looks at the account as a fallback in case he's unable to afford a large repair item not still under warranty. ""So far I've been doing the PMs and the other repairs I can out of my pocket,"" he says. He's used the escrow sparingly. ""I've paid out for three repairs on that truck - $2,000 for the radiator, two new tires and rotors, a few small repairs - and after that, I just let it build up. One thing that they told me is that I can use it to pay off my truck at the end of the lease. So far I've been saving that money to do that."" At press time, the available balance in his reserve was upwards of $11,000, more than enough to make the balloon payment.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Optional maintenance and other escrows</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">More and more carriers are offering maintenance escrows apart from lease-purchase contracts. These are optional, though still governed by the federal truth in leasing regulations.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">""It's really the contractor escrowing for the potential of mechanical failure,"" says Dart's Gundale. A disciplined owner-operator could do something similar apart from the carrier, Gundale adds, but ""how likely is he going to be to put money away into that savings account? We're making it easy for you to have the savings program.""</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Dart owner-operator Clark Lett, of Peterman, Ala., appreciates that ease. Lett's contributed 10 cents a mile to a maintenance account almost since Dart began offering the program, at least 12 years ago. Practices such as this helped make Lett a finalist for this year's Truckload Carriers.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Association's Owner-Operator of the Year Award.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">When Lett purchased his current truck, a 1996 International 9400, in the late 1990s, he doubled his maintenance escrow contribution from 5 cents a mile to 10 cents to fully cover future maintenance expenses and to assist saving for his truck payment. Ease of use, for Lett, is critical, and by eliminating the need to use credit cards at repair shops, he feels more secure.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">""When you're out on the highway needing some work done, you're not waiting to get a purchase order or to get money,"" he says. ""I tell my dispatcher what I need, give them my account ID number and my Social Security number,"" and they help make the service arrangements and set up the payment.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">When his escrow account gets high enough, Lett says, ""I pull some of it off and put it in my regular account.""</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Dallas-based FFE Transportation Services provides a similar accounting for contractors participating in its maintenance program, including a road service team. When an owner-operator needs service, says Brian Etchison, director of contractor relations, ""the fleet manager will advise the road service team how much funds [the owner-operator has] and they'll select a vendor based on that information.""</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">As with Dart, settlements reflect all expenditures from maintenance escrow accounts, which helps in tax preparation.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">The bottom line on maintenance escrows, says Etchison, is to make a breakdown less of a headache.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">""When a guy breaks down and has to fix his truck, it should be an annoyance, not a catastrophe.""</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Other optional escrow accounts at FFE are a tire and licensing-fee account and a tax account.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">""Many of our contractors work with business services to plan with those particular accounts,"" Etchison says. FFE offers ATBS' business service to all of its contractors, and includes it for ""all of our lease drivers,"" he says.</p>

,,,,,,default_layout,1,,,"Financing and Money Matters|Resource Center",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,138,"<p style=""color: #575555;"">Do you know your destination?</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">What if you pick up a load and, as you are scanning the bill of lading, you realize that it tells you exactly what's in the trailer but there is no destination. Would you start driving and hope to reach the destination? Of course not.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><!--more--></p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Yet so many people try to run their business and their life exactly that way. They work and work and work, and hope they get to a destination they've never identified. Then they wonder why they never get there.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">During my first year in the industry, I was excited about being an owner-operator, and I set a goal to buy my second truck within 12 months. I was told 100 times I was crazy, I needed more experience, it was a bad time to own trucks, etc.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">But I wrote down my goal, created a plan for it and followed up every week. I bought my second truck within nine months and I've never looked back. I even had that goal put on a small sign and mounted it on my dashboard. A little extreme? Maybe, but it reminded me of what goal-setting can accomplish.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">A goal gives you a destination to shoot for. When you miss, you'll know why, and you'll know how to adjust.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Don't make goal-setting too complicated - just get started. Try setting goals that are SMART, an acronym that stands for:</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>SPECIFIC.</strong></p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">A specific goal has a much greater chance of being accomplished than a general goal. To set a specific goal, answer these questions: Who is involved? What do I want to accomplish? When will I accomplish it? Why should I accomplish this goal? For example, a general goal would be: ""Improve fuel mileage."" But a specific goal would say: ""Increase my fuel mileage from 6.8 to 7.5 in the next 90 days.""</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>MEASURABLE.</strong></p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Establish a way to measure progress toward achieving each goal, asking questions such as how much, how many, or what are the mile markers along the way to accomplishment. That way you'll stay on track, reach your target dates and experience the exhilaration of achievement that spurs you on to reach your goal.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>ATTAINABLE.</strong></p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Your goals should be attainable, but they also should make you stretch. Goals that are really important to you will prompt you to develop the attitudes, abilities and skills to reach them.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>REALISTIC.</strong></p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">A goal must be something you're willing and able to work for. It has to be big enough to motivate you or you won't stick with it, even if you have the skills to complete it. Once you start to set goals and achieve them, you'll be encouraged to set bigger and bigger goals and achieve them.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>TIMELY.</strong></p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Your goals need a deadline. That motivates you to start working now and gives you a way to measure your progress. Your mission becomes much more clear when, for example, you know you have to improve your fuel mileage in 90 days. You need to try certain practices, measure their effectiveness and see what combination of steps will get you to the 90-day target.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">People with goals achieve more than people without goals. The trick is to just get started; don't put this off. In fact, set this magazine down right now, and write down your first goal. Follow the SMART guidelines and make that goal something you can achieve in 30 days and something that is important to you. It will change your life for the better.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">That first goal could be creating your first profit and loss statement or cost per mile report. It may be improving your fuel mileage by a half-mile per gallon. It could be something as simple as listening to your first audio book on business or success. It could be health-related - reducing cigarette use from a pack a day to half a pack, or taking a 15-minute daily walk. Whatever it is, just get started.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">It's like learning how to drive a truck. I can tell you all the steps, but you won't be a good driver until you practice. Get started and your life will never be the same.</p>
<strong>Dollars &amp; Sense: Any Road Will Get You There If You Don't Know Where You Are Going</strong><strong> </strong>(<a style=""color: #ff0000;"" href=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/pdf/DollarsSense.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Download PDF</a>)",,"2016-06-21 15:00:48",post,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/2016/06/21/dollars-sense-any-road-will-get-you-there-if-you-dont-know-where-you-are-going/,publish,1,ATSBlogM,schaiyote@arrowtruck.com,,,dollars-sense-any-road-will-get-you-there-if-you-dont-know-where-you-are-going,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2017-05-08 18:33:41"
,,,,,,default_layout,1,,,"Resource Center",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,145,"<p style=""color: #575555;"">Knowing the documents you need and when to apply for them will save you time and headaches when you're ready to obtain your operating authority.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">For drivers shifting to become an owner-operator with your own authority, the first dilemma is chicken or egg - do you buy your truck and then get set up as an owner-operator or do you complete the paperwork first before acquiring a rig?</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""></p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><!--more--></p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">You will save money and aggravation by completing your applications and securing your permits before buying a truck, says Rick McNeill, president of Motor Carrier Consultants of Mobile, Ala. At the very least, put off truck shopping until you've started the paperwork process. If you're going to lease on to a carrier, you can run under that firm's authority and don't need one of your own.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">""People will purchase a truck and trailer and put their company name on the truck, not realizing it's going to take at least three weeks for it to happen,"" McNeill says. ""In the meantime, they're sitting on a truck note and insurance before they can get any business to pay their bills.""</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Your first step is to file with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration for your U.S. Department of Transportation number and motor carrier number (operating authority). You must have a DOT number to apply for your authority. About 10 to 12 days after filing, the FMCSA will send out a ""first letter"" acknowledging the application has been reviewed and accepted.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Once you receive the first letter, you can buy liability and/or cargo insurance. Save time by shopping for insurance quotes after filing for your MC number, but hold off on buying coverage, McNeill says. It takes only 24 to 48 hours for an insurance company to post your insurance filing with FMCSA.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">At the same time you file your insurance, you should complete your BOC-3 process service agent form filing. This is a listing of registered process agents by state who, if a legal action was filed against your company from outside your base state, would accept legal documents on your behalf.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">It takes 24 to 48 hours for the filings to appear on the FMCSA federal register. Once the filings appear in the register, a mandatory five-day waiting period begins before the final authority is issued.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">During the period waiting for your MC number, don't forget to file for your Unified Carrier Registration, McNeill says. Launched in 2007, this program applies to all carriers transporting goods in interstate commerce. About 40 states participate in the program, which is administered at &gt;www.ucr.in.gov. This is an electronic filing that will show up when your truck goes through commercial scales. If you operate in a state that's not active in the program, you will be directed to register using another state as your base.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">You'll also want to check the states where you plan to operate for supplemental fuel taxes - Kentucky, New Mexico, New York and Oregon - and for state intrastate authority, McNeill says. Thirty states have intrastate authority, but enforcement hasn't been a high priority in some of them.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">You can't run your business without posting a copy of your operating authority in your vehicle. If you're in a hurry, Don Norman Associates www.donnormanassociates.com will fax your authority to you for a fee.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Larissa Jacquez of Burson, Calif., says she started setting up the hot shot transport company she plans to run with her partner and driver Brett Makowiedki in February and hopes they would be ready to go by May 1. She knew how to organize the corporate structure but was unfamiliar with trucking company regulations and requirements, so she turned to MCC for help. ""I wanted to make sure we had all of our paperwork right before we went out on the road,"" she says.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Here are the important documents you'll need to become an independent owner-operator. The sequence beginning with the U.S. Department of Transportation number will take about three weeks.</p>

<ul style=""color: #575555;"">
	<li>U.S. Department of Transportation number: Need this to apply for operating authority. Apply for this first.</li>
	<li>Motor Carrier number (operating authority): Issued by Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. Apply for this next. It will take longest to receive.</li>
	<li>Insurance: Buy liability and/or cargo coverage after notice your MC application has been accepted. Will be filed with FMCSA within 24-48 hours.</li>
	<li>BOC-3 process service agent form filing: File at same time you buy insurance.</li>
	<li>Unified Carrier Registration: Online filing required of all carriers transporting interstate goods.</li>
	<li>International Fuel Tax Agreement: Fuel tax form covering all states except Alaska and Hawaii.</li>
	<li>State supplemental fuel taxes: If you plan to run in any of four states that impose a supplemental fuel tax, you should register in those state programs.</li>
	<li>Intrastate commerce authority: Check if any of the states where you intend to operate require i<a id=""_GoBack"" style=""color: #ff0000;"" name=""_GoBack""></a>ntrastate authority.</li>

<strong>How to Become an Owner-Operator: A Resource for Getting Started</strong> (<a style=""color: #ff0000;"" href=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/pdf/HowToBecomeAnOwner.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Download PDF</a>)
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong><em>(NOTE: Article first published in the June, 2009 issue of Truckers News.)</em></strong></p>",,"2016-06-22 17:00:40",post,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/2016/06/22/how-to-become-an-owner-operator-a-resource-for-getting-started/,publish,1,ATSBlogM,schaiyote@arrowtruck.com,,,how-to-become-an-owner-operator-a-resource-for-getting-started,,,0,0,0,closed,closed,"2016-06-22 17:00:40"
,,,,,,default_layout,1,,,"Resource Center",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,148,"<p style=""color: #575555;"">Starting Line</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Before you dive into independence as an owner-operator, take time to assess your experience, finances, dedication and skills. Look in the mirror. You've been thinking about going into business for yourself as an owner operator, but are you ready? You crave the independence, but do you have what it takes to be successful?</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><!--more--></p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Now may not be the right time to go on your own. Today's freight environment is a minefield for even experienced owner-operators, so you need to do your homework before you jump into your own truck and business. ""Right now, there's not huge demand because freight is down,"" says Sheri Aaberg, general manager of ATBS Leasco, a Denver-based company that works with budding owner-operators. But, she adds, ""the want-to is still there.""</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Aaberg says the primary reasons a driver wants to be an owner-operator is to call his own shots and make more money. Many imagine being their own boss and having control over their career without thinking about accountability. The reality is that when you're in business, ""you have more accountability than you did when you were an employee,"" she says.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">When you own your truck and drive for others, you are a small-business owner. Before you commit to buying your own rig, take inventory of your finances, your earning potential and whether your business will support your expenses.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">""It's all about money,"" says John Nail, an owner-operator for about 10 years who's leased to Greatwide and dedicated to a Tyson Foods base at Union City, Tenn. ""You figure out your bills and what your base is. I look at what the shipper pays, how many miles I have to run to pay my mortgage, truck payments and everything else.""</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">In checking out possible income, Aaberg says you need to understand the ""entire compensation structure of a potential carrier, because it goes well beyond the pay per mile.""</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">In sizing up a carrier, you should learn about its terminal operation, how it dispatches and how much time you'll have to be on the road, Aaberg says. Decide what hauling specialty you want and if you have experience in that segment.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">How do you know if you're ready? Nail and Aaberg both recommend a minimum of one year of experience in your specialty, preferably much more. ""Get a sense of what you're doing before you stick your neck out so far you get it chopped off,"" Nail says. Nail, of Arbyrd, Mo., says he talked with both successful owner-operators and some who failed before he ventured out on his own. He even talked with his former landlord, who was an owner operator.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">""This business is real easy to fail in,"" he says.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Checklist</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Sheri Aaberg of ATBS Leasco says you should consider several things in mulling over whether you're owner-operator material:</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">1) Consider your personality, experience and knowledge to decide if you really want all the responsibilities of being your own boss - something to consider when you hit the road and your office goes with you. 2) Make a personal assessment. Do you have the qualities that being an owner-operator requires? Are you dedicated and reliable? Do you have the ability to set goals? Do you have financial planning, management and bookkeeping skills? Do you like to work with people? 3) Can you and your family accept the away-from-home time necessary to succeed? 4) Determine what kind of trucking -refrigerated, flatbed, dry van - you know and like. 5) Do you understand what customer service the carrier and shipper expect from you? 6) Have you investigated carriers that meet your experience and skills, and have you determined where you will be the best fit with the operations personnel? 7) Understand the ""total"" compensation structure above and beyond the rate per mile and the freight cycles of your prospective carrier. 8) Have you created a budget of both business and personal expenses, and are you disciplined enough to live within that budget? 9) Identify the equipment best suited to meet the need of your potential carrier and how much it will cost to maintain and repair it. You'll have to budget those costs. 10) Consider professional help and education to assist with budgeting and planning.</p>

,,,,,,default_layout,2,,,"Regulations and Compliance|Resource Center",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,154,"<p style=""color: #575555;""><em>Last Updated November 5, 2012</em></p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">This summary describes how to obtain a certificate of reporting and how brokers, motor carriers, contractors, public agencies, developers, and others must verify the fleets they hire or dispatch are in compliance with the Truck and Bus regulation. The regulation does not apply to state and local government vehicles, most solid waste collection trucks, drayage trucks that transport marine cargo, and public transit buses because they are already subject to other regulations.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><!--more--></p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>What are my responsibilities if I hire trucks as part of my business?</strong></p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Anyone who operates or directs the operation of any vehicle subject to the Truck and Bus regulation needs to verify that each hired company is either in compliance with the regulation or has reported compliance to the Air Resources Board (ARB). This requirement applies to any in-state or out-of-state motor carrier, California broker, or any California resident including but not limited to contractors, public agencies, and developers. The requirement does not apply to receivers or other parties that do not hire,and do not direct the operation of any vehicle that is subject to the regulation.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>How can I determine if the carrier that I hire has reported to ARB or is in compliance with the regulation?</strong></p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Owners that report to the Air Resources Board to use flexible compliance options must report information about all of the heavier vehicles in their fleet that operate in California and can print a certificate that confirms they have reported to the ARB. Fleet owners that comply by using the engine model year schedule are not required to report but have the option to report company information and to print a certificate that states they are complying with the engine model year schedule. Either certificate can be used by a motor carrier, broker or other entity as evidence the hired fleet has reported compliance with the regulation. Motor carriers/brokers or other entities must obtain copies of the certificate or other proof of compliance annually. ARB also posts the names and motor carrier numbers of the fleets that have reported compliance at http://www.arb.ca.gov/msprog/onrdiesel/tblookup.php.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>What can I do if the company I hire does not have a certificate?</strong></p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">If the fleet owner does not report to the ARB, then the owner must provide other documentation to demonstrate that their fleet complies with the engine model year schedules of the regulation. You should obtain a statement from the owner that verifies that they are aware of the Truck and Bus regulation (Title 13, California Code of Regulations, Section 2025) and are in compliance with the engine model year schedule. However, if you become aware that one or more vehicles in that fleet do not comply, then you cannot continue to use the services of the fleet.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>Do I need to verify compliance if I hire for services that require specific trucks or buses?</strong></p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Yes. If you hire a subcontractor for services of a truck, like dump trucks, concrete pumps , cranes, or charter buses, you are actively determining which companies and type of vehicle is needed to perform the service, and you will need to verify that the company you hire complies or has reported compliance to the ARB. For example, a contractor that directly hires a dump truck company to move debris from the roadside or hires a crane to lift a load, must verify compliance.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>If I order materials from a supplier, do I need to verify compliance for the shipper?</strong></p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">No. If you are not actively involved in determining which transportation company will deliver the materials or products then you are not responsible for verifying that the fleet is in compliance. In other words, the receiver does not actively determine whose trucks will make the delivery. The shipper could use their own trucks or ultimately contract out the delivery to another motor carrier. Therefore, the receiver would not be responsible for verifying compliance.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>Sometimes I work with other brokers to supplement a job, do I need to check compliance?</strong></p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">The contractual arrangement with a broker determines who is responsible for hiring each truck and verifying compliance with the regulation. The following are examples:</p>

<ul style=""color: #575555;"">
 	<li>If you contract with a broker to get more trucks to a job, but you ultimately deal directly with the sub-haulers and pay them for their services, then you need to verify compliance.</li>
 	<li>If you have an arrangement with another broker where the other broker hires and pays the subhaulers when you need them, then the broker is responsible to verify compliance of the subhaulers that he hires, and you are not because you do not determine who he hires.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>Do I need to verify compliance every time I hire a company that uses trucks?</strong></p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">No. If you hire a company to provide a service, other than transportation, and are not actively involved in determining what kind of trucks will be used, you are not responsible to verify compliance with the regulation. For example, if you order supplies and parts you are not actively involved in determining how your order is delivered nor in determining who ultimately delivers your order. Similarly, if you hire a contractor to do plumbing or electrical work, you are not actively involved in determining whether the contractor will use diesel trucks, and you are not involved in determining how the contractor arranges for equipment or supplies to be delivered to the job site.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>Where can I find more information about the regulation?</strong></p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Fact sheets, compliance tools and regulatory documents are available at www.arb.ca.gov/dieseltruck or by calling ARB's diesel hotline at (866) 6DIESEL (634-3735).</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong><em>While this document is intended to assist fleets with their compliance efforts, it is the sole responsibility of fleets to ensure compliance with the Truck and Bus Regulation.</em></strong></p>

,,,,,,default_layout,35,,,"Resource Center",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,160,"<p style=""color: #575555;"">Economic realities are forcing fleet managers to look at cost-saving alternatives in their operations that a few years ago simply weren't worth the trouble for many. As profits narrow or disappear and maintenance costs rise due to older equipment, parts undoubtedly receive more attention.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><!--more-->While fleets reasonably might look at quality ""will-fit"" aftermarket parts as an alternative, some might be tempted to look the other way or not ask questions if they can save a few bucks on parts that are actual counterfeits - parts that don't have a clear manufacturer standing behind them and instead are passed off as being name-brand items. But those fleets may be taking a shortcut to downtime, lost revenue, ruined warranties and - in a worst-case scenario - opening up the possibility of injuries or fatal highway accidents.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">To be sure, large corporations keenly are interested in protecting their brand trademarks from knockoff producers. There is much at stake: According to the Federal Trade Commission, the proliferation of counterfeit parts is a $12 billion-a-year worldwide problem in the automotive industry, last year accounting for sales of $3 billion in the United States alone.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">For corporations that have spent years - if not decades - building their brand reputations, counterfeiters threaten more than just their bank accounts: counterfeit automotive parts can erode global goodwill and lead to millions of dollars spent in the courts on false warranty claims and lawsuits or trying to shut down counterfeit part manufacturers.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">From the fleet end of things, paying a drastically reduced price for a part most likely won't pan out. The higher prices built into the cost of legitimate automotive parts includes many services that counterfeit part producers never would dream of providing, including warranty protection and technical support and education.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">""I absolutely believe that counterfeit products cost fleets more in the long run, with increased repairs, lost warranty and costs associated with safety,"" says Gloria Pliler, director of parts procurement for Phoenix-based Swift Transportation. ""It would be unconscionable to save a dollar on an inferior part that resulted in an injury either to the technician who installed the part or to the motoring public."" In addition, the counterfeit organization is, in effect, stealing from the original manufacturer, which most likely will have to increase prices for original parts as a result, Pliler says.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Ground zero for fakes Brett Heavner, an attorney and partner at intellectual property law firm Finnegan, says old stories that somewhat legitimize counterfeit parts or downplay their darker side have been exposed as just that - stories that help to assuage the consciences of people who feed the demand for counterfeit products around the world.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">""Historically, people thought it was kind of funny to go out and buy a fake Gucci purse or Rolex watch,"" Heavner says. ""But counterfeit replacement parts are quite dangerous and have the potential for some very serious damage to individuals and property."" Most of the money generated by counterfeit operations is going to organized crime or some other type of illegal activity, Heavner believes. ""Terrorist groups will sometimes use counterfeit parts to finance their activities,"" he says. ""Most of these are people that you don't want to help out by buying their products. There is some evidence that the 1993 attacks on the World Trade Center were financed by knockoff T-shirt sales.""</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Heavner has spent 14 years studying counterfeit operations around the world and has determined that about 80 percent of all knockoff goods originate in China. The local spin to foreigners who inquire about fake products is that plants with a legitimate contract to produce Western goods simply run production lines a bit longer than authorized in order to make some extra money. So the products are legitimate, the story goes, but they can be sold at dramatically discounted prices because they have been made without the original manufacturer's knowledge or permission.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">In reality, Heavner says, what typically happens is that someone close to the manufacturing line, usually a line worker, will steal parts crucial to the making of the product in question - tools, dyes or proprietary components or features - and sell them to another distributor who will attempt to copy them for their own manufacturing efforts. Once the part has been studied and duplicated, it often will be returned to the original plant without the OEM ever knowing that it has been compromised.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Take a closer look The Chinese, Heavner says, have a long history of reverse-engineering Western products and technology. But today, with constantly-improving computers and the enhanced printing and imaging capabilities they offer, it's a lot easier for these companies to make a high-quality counterfeit than it used to be - and therefore easier for end-use consumers to be fooled by those products, he says.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">While the bogus part itself may be hard to differentiate from an OEM product, many times the bogus part will arrive in a plain, pasteboard white box without logos on it. And the part itself likely will lack any identification or serial numbers.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">""There's a reason for that,"" says Kenneth Calhoun, vice president of operations and customer relations for Truck Centers of Arkansas, a Daimler Trucks dealership based in Little Rock. ""The way our laws tend to be written, if there is a direct copying of trademarks and that sort of thing, then the OEM has a lot of additional leverage from a legal standpoint,"" says Calhoun, a member of the Counterfeit Parts Task Force of the American Trucking Associations' Technology &amp; Maintenance Council. But if the fake only has been reverse-engineered to meet the measurement requirements and doesn't have any markings on it, it's a lot harder to land a favorable verdict in court, he says.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Still, more and more parts are showing up in packaging that at least approximates legitimate graphics and logos. And that has given OEMs an opening for combating counterfeits. Heavner says many companies soon will start offering packaging with hard-to-duplicate holograms, which will help technicians confirm the product's integrity. In addition, individual parts soon may be encrypted with encoded microchips or global barcodes to help verify the part's lineage.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Gamble for fleets Obviously, using a counterfeit part on a commercial truck is a huge gamble, with lower prices on one side of the ledger and engine/vehicle damage and safety concerns on the other. Heavner has many stories about the damage counterfeit parts have caused on vehicles, and they're enough to raise the hair on the back of any fleet manager's neck.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Heavner recounts what he describes as ""a famous incident"" that happened in Africa: A technician fitted a bus with counterfeit pads that used compressed grass as the pad material. ""Of course, this grass failed, and the bus overturned with a large loss of life,"" says Heavner, who also cites cases in the United States where counterfeit pads were made with compressed sawdust instead of asbestos or proper materials. ""We've seen oil filters where the filter element has been replaced with rags or shredded newspapers,"" he says. ""Not surprisingly, these filters ended up causing fires and severe engine damage to the vehicles they were used on.""</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Even seemingly benign counterfeit parts have the potential to cause catastrophic injuries, Calhoun says. ""We recently looked at the case of a fuel tank cap which had been counterfeited. When you look closely at it, it was clear this part had been designed with a lot of care, to the point that it was virtually an exact copy of the OEM cap.""</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">But the legitimate OEM cap was fitted with plastic plugs designed to melt quickly in the event of a vehicle fire and allow the fuel tank to vent, Calhoun says. ""When the manufacturer tested this counterfeit cap, they discovered that its vent plugs didn't let go until they'd reached temperatures of around 600 degrees,"" he says. ""So any vehicle with that cap on the fuel tank that catches fire is suddenly transformed into a giant bomb.""</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Given the increasing sophistication of counterfeit parts, it's possible for anyone to be fooled by a bad component these days. But Heavner warns that knowingly putting a counterfeit part on a truck or trailer opens fleets up to a wide range of legal actions should that part fail and injure someone.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">""You're a lot more likely to be held liable by anybody injured in that accident,"" he says. Instead of being the victim of a bad part, the claimant will allege that the fleet committed an intentional tort, or some sort of negligence at the least. The prosecuting attorney will argue that the fleet would not expect a counterfeit part to have the same standard of quality and safety as a genuine part. ""So those actions could make things a lot worse if you were ever to be sued by anyoneinjured in an accident,"" Heavner says.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">What to do? Given the dangers of counterfeit parts, what should a fleet do if it thinks it's been sold a bogus part or suspects one is to blame for a vehicle failure? First, immediately replace the part installed on all trucks with genuine parts and remove any stock remaining on the shelves, Pliler says. Next, ascertain where the product was purchased in order to educate the supplier to the fleet's zero-toleration stance for the purchase and use of counterfeit products. Last, notify the OEM so it can address the problem legally.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">""Increasingly, original equipment manufacturers are getting set up to process counterfeit parts information and help you out,"" Heavner says. Online forms or a hotline number often are available to tell OEMs about the part and where it was purchased, and where to send them a picture of the fake. ""You may not get your money back, but you can at least help put a stop to that particular stream of counterfeit parts,"" he says.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Perhaps a fleet's best defense against counterfeit parts is simply to be vigilant on the front end of the acquisition process. ""It sounds like a cliché, but I constantly preach common sense when it comes to counterfeit parts,"" Calhoun says. ""If something doesn't look quite right, or if a deal seems too good to be true, odds are it is. If somebody is having a fire sale, or a special inventory reduction deal, ask yourself some questions."" Is this really a current issue product? If it is, is there really a good reason for somebody to have such a clearance sale? ""If the answer is no, then you probably need to ask some more questions,"" he says.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Spotting the fakes</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Poor packaging and craftsmanship, low price are giveaways.</p>
<p style=""color: #575555;"">Brett Heavner, an attorney and partner at intellectual property law firm Finnegan, lists five basic points he feels any fleet manager should consider if he suspects he has a counterfeit part on his hands:</p>

<ul style=""color: #575555;"">
	<li>Look carefully at the packaging. If the packaging is flimsy, or if its color or layout is not quite the same as the product you usually buy, or if there is an insert or instructions that usually are included in the packaging that is missing from the part you've bought, those are all good signs that the product probably is counterfeit.</li>
	<li>Be wary of parts that don't look right. If there are installation difficulties, or if the paint isn't quite as neat or a little sloppy, those are good signs you've got a knockoff.</li>
	<li>Be wary of online purchases, swap meets or a guy you don't know who says they've got a great overrun deal. You generally can't go wrong buying parts from legitimate, wellknown and reputable dealers.</li>
	<li>If the deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. Say you're getting it at 10 percent of the price you normally pay for the part. That's a good sign something is not right.</li>
	<li>Consider the type of parts you're purchasing. Studies show that parts sold in volume -such as oil filters, air filters, brake pads, belts, hoses and spark plugs - are the ones counterfeiters typically target for production, compared to smaller-volume parts that do not get replaced as frequently and are not as profitable for these companies to produce.</li>

<strong>¿QUÉ HAY EN EL AIRE? </strong>
<ul style=""color: #575555;"">
 	<li><strong>NOx y hollín </strong>– tienen el mayor impacto en en nuestro medio ambiente<strong>
</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>NOx (óxidos de nitrógeno)</strong> son un grupo de gases altamente reactivos, que contienen nitrógeno y oxígeno en cantidades diferentes</li>
 	<li>El <strong>dióxido de nitrógeno</strong>, en conjunto con las partículas en el aire pueden usualmente verse como una capa roja-café sobre muchas áreas urbanas</li>
 	<li>La materia partícula (el hollín) es el humo visible que sale del motor.</li>
 	<li>El hollín se compone de combustible que no se ha quemado, carbono y otros materiales sólidos.</li>
</ul>
<!--more-->
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>CUMPLIENDO CON LOS NIVELES DE LA EPA 07</strong></p>

<ul style=""color: #575555;"">
 	<li>Para poder cumplir con los niveles de materias particulares de la EPA 2007, todos los fabricantes buscaron un sistema de tratamiento del escape.</li>
 	<li>La tecnología dentro de este <strong>sistema de tratamiento</strong> es el<strong> filtro de partículas de diésel</strong>.</li>
 	<li>En lugar de enviar hollín a la atmósfera, el DPF atrapa el hollín y usa calor para oxidarlo. Para que lo que salga del escape sea un aire mucho más limpio.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>¿CÓMO FUNCIONA? </strong></p>

<ul style=""color: #575555;"">
 	<li>El DPF es realmente un <strong>filtro cerámico</strong> que tiene miles de pequeños canales Conforme el escape pasa a través de éstos canales, el hollín se queda atrapado dentro de las paredes de los canales y no puede salir a través del tubo de escape.</li>
 	<li>El filtro cerámico se parece a una <strong>estructura de panal</strong>.</li>
 	<li>Esta estructura está cubierta con una capa de catalizador químico que contiene pequeñas cantidades de metales preciosos, usualmente <strong>platino</strong> o <strong>paladio</strong>, que interactúan con los contaminantes oxidados de la corriente de escape (Oxido de carbono e hidrocarburos no quemados), resultando en emisiones venenosas.</li>
 	<li>El hollín que se queda atrapado dentro de las paredes de los canales no permita que salga a través del tubo de escape.</li>
 	<li>De vez en cuando, se debe de remover el hollín que se ha acumulado en las paredes de los canales del DPF para permanecer efectivo.</li>
 	<li>Esto se llama <strong>“Regeneración.”</strong></li>
 	<li>La regeneración es un <strong>proceso de oxidación</strong> que usa el calor para remover el hollín del filtro.</li>
 	<li>El proceso de regeneración es realmente simple.</li>
 	<li>Hay dos etapas de este procedimiento: <strong>1) ACTIVA y 2) PASIVA</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>REGENERACIÓN PASIVA </strong></p>

<ul style=""color: #575555;"">
 	<li>La regeneración pasiva <strong>ocurre naturalmente</strong> durante un manejo constante, cuando el motor logra la temperatura requerida para operar.</li>
 	<li>El DPF contiene un catalizador de oxidación que está cubierto con metales preciosos.</li>
 	<li>Bajo una operación normal en carretera, la regeneración pasiva ocurre conforme el catalizador se calienta lo suficiente para oxidar el hollín y convertirlo en dióxido de carbono.</li>
 	<li>El dióxido de carbono sale a través de los tubos de escape.</li>
 	<li>Cualquier residuo restante se convierte en cenizas que se acumulan en el frasco del DPF.</li>
 	<li>El <strong>proceso es continuo</strong>, por lo tanto, cuando el vehículo alcance la temperatura de operación, el DPF iniciará su regeneración pasiva.</li>
 	<li>La regeneración pasiva ocurre naturalmente bajo cargas uniformes altas del motor.</li>
 	<li>El catalizador en el DPF oxida el hollín cuando las temperaturas del escape alcanzan 600°F.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>REGENERACIÓN ACTIVA </strong></p>

<ul style=""color: #575555;"">
 	<li>• Con el paso del tiempo, la regeneración pasiva no es suficiente para prevenir la acumulación de hollín en el DPF. Y es cuando la segunda etapa de limpieza es utilizada. Esta etapa se conoce como la<strong> “regeneración activa”</strong>.</li>
 	<li>La computadora en el motor de camión indica que el DPF necesita limpieza, y si la temperatura de operación es lo suficientemente alta, <strong>automáticamente</strong> iniciará una regeneración activa.</li>
 	<li>Por lo general, la regeneración activa inicia cuando una pequeña cantidad de combustible se introduce al tubo de escape entre el turbo cargador y el DPF.</li>
 	<li>Este combustible es atomizado en un rocío extremadamente ligero que no se quema. En su lugar, cuando entra en contacto con el catalizador dentro del DPF, genera un calor intenso – hasta 1100 grados Fahrenheit
– que oxida cualquier hollín restante dentro del filtro cerámico.</li>
 	<li>Again, the soot is oxidized and el dióxido de carbono sale por los tubos de escape y la ceniza se acumula dentro del frasco.</li>
 	<li>Una pequeña cantidad de combustible se introduce al tubo de escape para generar un calor intenso – mayor de 1100 grados Fahrenheit – que oxida cualquier hollín restante.</li>
 	<li>Dependiendo de cómo maneje, la regeneración activa <strong>puede suceder una vez al día</strong>.</li>
 	<li>Cada regeneración<strong> puede tomar 30 minutos o más</strong>.</li>
 	<li>Si usted reduce su velocidad o detiene su vehículo, la<strong> podrá interrumpirse y tendrá que reiniciar</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>REGENERACIÓN AUTOMÁTICA</strong></p>

<ul style=""color: #575555;"">
 	<li>En general, los sistemas de tratamiento posterior tienen un <strong>monitoreo automático</strong>. Cuando los niveles de hollín son lo suficientemente altos, el sistema automáticamente inicia una regeneración activa.</li>
 	<li>La velocidad del vehículo puede incrementar cuando se detiene para mantener las condiciones de regeneración apropiadas.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>REGENERACIÓN EN ESTACIONAMIENTO</strong></p>

<ul style=""color: #575555;"">
 	<li>Habrá ocasiones cuando conductores necesitarán desempeñar una regeneración manual o en
“<strong>estacionamiento</strong>”. Esto puede ser debido a que el conductor canceló una regeneración o si una regeneración automática inició pero fué interumpida cuando se detuvo el vehículo.</li>
 	<li>•Las regeneraciones en estacionamiento son regeneraciones activas <strong>iniciadas por el conductor</strong> cuando el vehículo está detenido, con el motor funcionando, con el freno de estacionamiento aplicado. Usualmente hay un método de accionamiento del tablero para iniciar una regeneración en estacionamiento.</li>
 	<li><strong> Precauciones</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Temperaturas de escape extremadamente altas durante una regeneración activa.</li>
 	<li>Manténgase lejos de combustibles y personas.
<ul>
 	<li>Lugares de trabajo con muchas personas, gasolineras, túneles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style=""color: #575555;""><strong>MANEJANDO CON EL DPF </strong></p>

<ul style=""color: #575555;"">
 	<li>Dos opciones de montado
<ul>
 	<li>Montado en el marco cercano al escape turbo</li>
 	<li>Back of cab</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Fuel requirements
<ul>
 	<li>DPF requires use of <strong>Ultra Low Sulfur Fuel</strong> and approved <strong>diesel CJ4 engine oils</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Limpieza
<ul>
 	<li>El DPF requiere una limpieza profesional cada 150,000 –250,000 millas</li>
</ul>

Pay attention to your living expenses while on the road so you'll bring home more of your pay.

Plan ahead to meet your needs. Stock your cab with the right supplies, and you'll save money on the basic human necessities listed below.

<!--more-->
<h2>Water</h2>
A trucker stays healthier and more focused by hydrating the body with cool water instead of soda. Without enough water, your insides and your mind feel like they're drooping as much as a water-starved plant.

Constantly buying bottled water adds unnecessary additional expenses to your budget. Convenience-store water prices also vary widely from location to location. Public water is free, but its quality is heavily dependent on the water sources nearby.

Instead of buying disposable bottles of water or relying on questionable local water sources, bring jugs of water from home. Use a reusable drink bottle while you're driving or pick up a filtering pitcher to keep in the cab fridge. If you're buy a filtering pitcher, load up on tap water at the sinks of rest stops or gas stations, and then let the filter take care of any impurities.
<h2>Clothes</h2>
Truckers aren't known as fashion victims, so there's not much risk of your spending too much of your hard-earned cash on work clothes. But you'll save yourself hassle and extra expenses if you pack a few clothing essentials in the cab.

Throw a pair of flip-flops and a bathing suit into your bag. The flip-flops will keep your feet from directly touching germ-laden shower floors, which could send you to the doctor for a foot infection or worse.

The bathing suit will be useful when you can't find a shower but know there's a refreshing swimming hole or lake along your route. You should also bring at least three bath towels so you always have a fresh one to use in the truck-stop shower.

A reflective vest is a must-have to keep you visible during late-night breakdowns or stops in busy areas. Take rain gear and gloves along, and pack at least one warm coat on any trip during which there's a risk of cold weather. If you do get caught in a cold snap or downpour, you won't have to spend extra money buying a new coat.
<h2>Food</h2>
Eating out is one of a trucker's biggest financial temptations. When you're hungry, it's hard to listen to your wallet's warnings to be frugal. Today, a hungry trucker can spend as much as $20 on one fast food meal in some locations.

Save yourself a load of dough by having a cab refrigerator that's stocked with deli meat, salad greens, sliced cheese, and juice. Bring individually portioned foods from home or buy ready-made frozen meals you microwave in the cab.

With an inverter, you can power a refrigerator, microwave, and other appliances with your truck's batteries. Many truckers even have 12-volt slow cookers in their cabs. These truckers start stew or chili in the slow cooker first thing in the morning, and then they let the meal simmer until dinnertime. Do this, and you get a ""home-cooked"" meal—no matter where you are—without spending a fortune.

Coffeemakers, toasters, and single-burner ranges are also helpful for cost-effective morning cups of coffee and scrambled eggs. Single-burner ranges are available in butane-fueled styles as well as electric-powered versions.
<h2>Shelter</h2>
If your cab is set up right, your shelter rides with you wherever you go. Make the space more comfy by bringing along an electric blanket for those extra-cold nights. You won't be tempted to stay in a nice, warm hotel.

A heating pad and massager are also nice truck supplies to have on hand when it's been a long day in the driver's seat. Supplies like these may save you a trip to the chiropractor or drug store, especially if you pack some over-the-counter painkillers in your first-aid kit.

Bring along ear plugs for the noisier sleeping and napping spots. Using a loud fan is also an option when you need to block out external noise so you can rest comfortably. You’ll save money when you don't waste gas looking for a quieter spot to dream for the night.
<h2>Entertainment</h2>
In today's society, entertainment is nearly considered a basic need. And it's true that DVD players, gaming systems, and satellite radio systems provide you with relaxing activities after your work hours are done.

If you're so bored that you visit local bars or stores, money tends to flow out of your wallet. When you have TV, gaming, music, or Wi-Fi capabilities, you get your fix of fun without draining your wallet.

If you need to be around people and require regular exercise, consider joining a fitness gym that has locations where you routinely drive. This way, you can exercise, shower, and talk to new people without spending a fortune. Be sure to get a month-to-month contract so you aren't bound to a long-term commitment if your career or routes change.

You can text or call anyone you choose at any time (except while driving your rig). Dispatch is tracking you and checking in wherever you go, thanks to your GPS system. Plus, you've got satellite radio for entertainment, so who needs more?<!--more-->

New truckers who debate the usefulness of owning a CB radio use the reasons above to support the notion that the Citizens' Band radio is an obsolete relic from the '70s. However, the opposite is really true. CB radios are relevant safety and communication tools that are commonly used by truckers today.

Be smart and learn the basics of using a CB radio. Here are some facts about CB radio communication, along with five ways to appreciate a CB radio.
<h2>1) Use Your CB to Get Local Information in Real Time</h2>
A CB radio has a range of around one to five miles but can carry a signal much farther in some circumstances. There are few restrictions on CB radios. You may use your CB while driving, and no license is required to broadcast over your radio as a personal CB operator. If, instead, you use your smartphone while driving, you face fines or worse if an accident occurs while you're chatting on the phone.

Because of the very location-specific communication available with your CB radio, you get updates about what's happening right at the moment you approach an interstate work zone or weigh station. Truckers on the opposite side of the freeway or state highway can tell you what's going on just up ahead. Truckers in front of you—who've just passed a problem you now face—can let you know how it's going on your side of the road.
<h2>2) Understand How a CB Radio Is Set Up</h2>
There are simple and deluxe CB radios available. Most CBs will have three main control knobs on the radio unit for volume control, channel selection, and squelch control. On high-end units, you can choose Single Side Band (SSB) or AM mode. SSB mode offers a greater range of listening possibilities and less background noise, but you can only communicate with other SSB CB radios.

Depress the microphone transmission button on the hand-held microphone to speak, and keep the button pressed down while speaking. After speaking, release the button so you can listen to the responses and other local talk.
<h2>3) Pick the Right Channel to Offer or Obtain Information</h2>
There are 40 channels you may use as a personal CB radio operator. Most truckers use the unofficial channel 19 (27.185 MHz) to communicate. This channel offers highway traffic information from truckers and other drivers.

You'll find a lot of aimless chatter along with the useful information on channel 19. (Some truckers have nicknamed the channel ""Sesame Street"" due to its frequently childish content.) Say ""break one-nine,"" in order to make sure you're being heard and ""break"" when you want to ask a serious question.

Channel 9 (27.065 MHz) is an emergency-communication channel. It's monitored by local officials, federal agencies, and first responders. Use this channel to report a serious injury, accident or hazardous road condition. <em>Only</em> use channel 9 to communicate life-threatening emergencies. However, you may listen to channel 9 at any time to hear updates on accident sites and weather-related events near your location.
<h2>4) Learn How to Operate Your CB Settings</h2>
One of the most important benefits of CB radios is their ability to transmit even where there are no cellphone towers or Wi-Fi signals. If you're stuck in a rural location with no reception, your CB radio still works.

Learn how to adjust your CB settings in various locations. Your microphone gain should be set to maximum to be heard well. If you're in a populated area, switch on the automatic noise limiter (ANL) setting to reduce radio clutter from multiple sources. You can also turn up your squelch button to reduce static, but this will limit your ability to hear all stations and CBs in your range.
<h2>5) Familiarize Yourself with CB Lingo</h2>
There are multiple guides to CB lingo and radio 10-codes online and at truck stops. Learning the meaning of 10-codes helps you know what is being communicated by police and law enforcement as it may affect public safety. There are General Purpose and APCO (Association of Police Communications Officers) 10-codes that vary slightly. For example, 10-53 stands for “Road Blocked at__.” One of the funniest aspects of CB lingo is the huge array of nicknames that semi-truck drivers have adopted. Just search the internet for “Trucker Slang” and you may find some amusing results.

Give yourself a handle, too, or you risk earning a nickname that makes you cringe. Older truckers can be snarky, but they try to tease only in fun. When there's an emergency, truckers work together to help warn other drivers and save lives. In one recent case, truckers communicated by CB and were able to box in a kidnapping suspect's vehicle on the highway until law enforcement arrived.

"Feeling Isolated? 4 Key Ways to Stay Upbeat on the Road | Arrow Truck Sales","Many truckers suffer from poor mental health as well as poor physical health. Since happy drivers are healthy drivers, read on for some tips to stay upbeat.",60,3,,,,,,,"Resource Center",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,426,"According to a recent <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/22/us/trucking-jobs.html?_r=0"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener noreferrer"">New York Times article</a>, truckers across the country feel like ""throwaway people"" who aren't valued or even seen by the majority of the population. Truckers work absurdly long hours, often for too little payoff. They spend their time on the road getting cut off by dangerous, irate drivers of much smaller cars, and they suffer from health problems related to getting too little healthy food, too much junk food and too little exercise.
<!--more-->


It's no wonder, then, that many truckers suffer from poor mental health as well as poor physical health. Happy drivers are healthy drivers, and we know you care about living a long and happy life because of—not in spite of—your career. Below, we outline a few tips that can help you stay mentally healthy and upbeat while you travel.
<h2>1. Eat Healthily and Exercise Frequently</h2>
Activities that keep you physically healthier also keep you mentally healthier. As a truck driver, make eating healthy foods and exercising a top priority as frequently as possible. Before you leave home, stock your truck with supplies like granola bars, apples and carrots. Invest in a cooler or small refrigerator where you can store salads, fruits and other healthy but perishable items. Don’t indulge in gas station food.

Along with eating healthily and avoiding foods loaded with sugar, fat and salt, take frequent breaks during the day to stretch. Even pulling over at a rest stop for ten minutes to stretch your arms, legs, neck and back will rejuvenate you and keep your limbs flexible. Stretch at the start and end of the day, and try getting involved in a sport you can participate in anywhere, like walking or jogging.
<h2>2. Listen to Music, Podcasts and Messages from Friends</h2>
Driving is a solitary activity. While many drivers choose their career precisely for the solitude, the loneliness can quickly wear some people down.

Talking to family members obviously alleviates the loneliness, but many states prohibit drivers from talking on cell phones while they drive. Plus, even when talking on the phone is legal, it's not a good idea for truck drivers to talk and drive. Even if you're using a hands-off phone, your attention can still be split between the road and the person you're talking to, which decreases safety and increases accident potential.

Instead, if you want a little human connection, scout out some podcasts to download and stream while driving. Podcasting has exploded in recent years, and with thousands and thousands available on iTunes, anyone can find a podcast they’ll enjoy. Whether you want a talk show about trucking tips or a narrative podcast on almost any subject, it’s easy to find an engrossing podcast that passes the time and helps you connect with the outside world.

If podcasts aren't your thing, create playlists you can listen to while you drive—or, better yet, ask a loved one to create a playlist for you. You can also have family members and friends record conversations and messages to you and play those while you drive.

And if you have the budget for satellite radio, SiriusXM is an ideal way to listen to news, sports, weather, music and talk shows from coast to coast.
<h2>3. Practice Meditation</h2>
Driving is stressful. When you spend the majority of your time on the road, you see much more than your fair share of poor driving. And, as a trucker, you spend a lot of time surrounded by drivers who don't know how to drive around trucks—or just don't care.

When you spend hours getting cut off, it's hard to unwind at the end of the day, knowing that you may need to get up at in a few hours and sit behind the wheel again. Stress can decrease your sleep quality, raise your blood pressure and contribute to a host of other health problems.

Meditation is a great way to reduce anxiety at the end of the day, restore your sense of calm, and sleep better. If you don't have time to learn to meditate, you're in luck—there are plenty of helpful, free podcasts geared towards beginners. Check out apps like:
<ul>
 	<li><em>Stop, Breathe, and Think</em>. This personalized app guides you through meditations depending on your emotions.</li>
 	<li><em>Meditation Oasis</em>. This app offers instructions for meditations, meditative music and basic guided meditations.</li>
 	<li><em>Daily Meditation Podcast</em>. Listen to this podcast for daily updates with new techniques and guided meditation sessions.</li>
</ul>
If you've never meditated before, you might have a hard time quieting your mind. But keep at it: meditation is a learned skill that gets better and better with practice.
<h2>4. See a Mental Health Provider</h2>
As a truck driver who hopes to live a long and healthy life, you need to take mental illnesses as seriously as physical illness. If you think you suffer from a chronic illness like anxiety, depression or PTSD, take the time to schedule an appointment with a doctor who can diagnose you and guide you towards the proper treatment.
<h2>Enjoy Life on the Road</h2>
Life as a trucker isn't always easy, but it doesn't have to contribute to poor mental health. Follow the tips above to make your life easier and happier.

"Choosing a Reefer for Your Food Service Business | Arrow Truck Sales","Before you purchase a refrigerated trailer (commonly called a ""reefer"") for your food service business, ask yourself these questions about it first.",30,3,,,,,,,"Resource Center",,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/diseltruck.jpg,diseltruck.jpg,"E:\Sites\arrowtruck_com\blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/diseltruck.jpg",446,diseltruck,,,,,,,,,,,,,445,"<img class=""size-medium wp-image-446 alignleft"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/diseltruck-300x156.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""156"" />When you purchase a refrigerated trailer  for your produce or food service business, ask yourself a few questions about how suitable the trailer will be for your business. Of course, make sure your truck has the power to haul the trailer at its full capacity. Five other concerns are addressed below.<!--more-->
<h2><strong>Is the Refrigeration System Adequate?</strong></h2>
Your refrigerated trailer runs off a separate system from the one used by your semi-truck. Most likely, the reefer's compressor runs off of a power source like its own diesel engine. The compressor and refrigeration equipment should be rated to chill or freeze a space as large as or slightly larger than the interior of the food cargo area of the trailer. This way, the refrigeration equipment isn't overloaded on extremely hot days.

For long trailers, you need ductwork to reach the entire length of the interior space to avoid having produce that's fine on one end and improperly chilled on the other end of the same load. A front bulkhead is an option to have installed. The bulkhead increases the amount of space for return airflow and can increase the efficiency of your refrigeration system.
<h2><strong>How Good Is the Insulation?</strong></h2>
Whichever type of insulation you use, it must be efficient enough to keep your product at the correct temperature no matter what the weather's like outside. Your refrigeration unit can only do so much. If cold air constantly escapes through trailer-body leaks and poorly insulated walls and floors, your refrigerated trailer may never reach the correct temperature for the product you're transporting.

If you show up with seafood that's five or six degrees off from the safe temperature range, your customer can refuse that load. It’s essential that you invest in proper insulation and sealing to keep cold air inside the food compartment of your refrigerated trailer.

Be aware that the insulation will affect the interior dimensions of the trailer and not the exterior dimensions. If you add more insulation to a reefer, you lose interior space. Your normal delivery setup inside the food compartment may have to be altered to accommodate the reduction in space.
<h2><strong>What Kind of Door Is Used for Deliveries?</strong></h2>
How often do the rear doors of your trailer open during a delivery day? Does the entire load get taken off at a distribution center? Or does your truck make multiple stops during the delivery schedule?

A roll-up door is extremely convenient when drivers must open and close the refrigerated trailer repeatedly. However, a roll-up door poses a huge energy leak. Products closest to the rolling door may not stay as cold as they should. The refrigeration system must work harder to keep the entire product space cold.

Insulated side-by-side doors may be more of a pain to open repeatedly. However, their assistance in keeping your rig energy-efficient makes them the better choice for a refrigerated food delivery trailer despite the slight inconvenience.

Some people use the curtains made of flexible strips behind rolling doors to block warm air from entering the trailer compartment. Be aware that these strips are very prone to breakage when loading and unloading your food freight.
<h2><strong>What Are the Semi-Trailer Measurements?</strong></h2>
If you're buying your semi-truck separate from the reefer, you want to make sure you have a good fit between trailer and truck. All connections, lights and hookups should work properly between the truck and trailer.

The chassis of the truck and that of the trailer must also be taken into account. Do they align properly? Will there be any strange hauling issues because of height misalignment? Will the doors and other access points open properly when the truck and trailer are connected?
<h2></h2>
You have to follow some pretty strict rules when transporting food. The U.S. government's Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) sets strict rules about how your food-service truck should be set up.

The inside of your trailer must be sufficiently sealed to prevent insect and rodent infestation. The cargo area must be designed so that FSMA and other inspectors can easily assess the cleanliness and interior temperature of the trailer. No vents or ductwork should drip on food, and no materials other than food or food-safe items should be allowed in the reefer.

Interior surfaces should be made of materials that can easily be washed and disinfected. Stainless steel is one material that is often used on floors and walls of reefers. Food-grade epoxy is also used as wall and ceiling material, since it is very durable and easy to keep clean.

You must also make certain that all racks, pallets and load-handling tools are kept safe and free of contaminants. Any transport vehicles or containers used for food handling must be marked ""for food use only."" These items should be secured inside the truck when it's moving.

"Runaway Truck Ramps | Arrow Truck Sales, Inc.","Runaway truck ramps are important features for truckers driving in mountainous areas. Read more about runaway truck ramps and locations where you may need one.",60,3,,,,,,,"Resource Center",,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Truck.jpg,Truck.jpg,"E:\Sites\arrowtruck_com\blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Truck.jpg",453,Truck,,,,,,,,,,,,,452,"<img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-453"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Truck-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""225"" />Runaway truck ramps are important highway features for truckers driving in mountainous areas. Familiarize yourself with the locations of ramps wherever you are hauling goods on roads with steep grades. Here is a quick guide to runaway truck ramps and four locations where you may need to use one.

<!--more-->
<h2>A Quick Guide to Runaway Truck Ramps</h2>
A truck escape ramp is generally built on a highway headed downhill. If the grade increases too rapidly, a truck in a too-high-gear may be unable to downshift. Brakes may be ineffective. The installation of a runaway truck ramp decreases the likelihood of out-of-control rigs causing road closures, injuries and fatalities.

Factors that determine the placement of a runaway truck ramp include:
<ul>
 	<li>Runaway-truck accident rate at same grade</li>
 	<li>Percent of slope on road</li>
 	<li>Length of steep grade</li>
 	<li>Total traffic volume on road</li>
 	<li>Frequency of crashes along stretch of highway</li>
</ul>
Placement of a runaway truck ramp also depends on the location of sharp turns and end-of-grade conditions like the location of a school or busy intersection.

Flat, unpaved runaway ramps use gravel up to 48 inches deep to stop runaway. There are long ascending runaway ramps that head uphill. These use an arrester bed of gravel or sand combined with a gravity escape ramp (the uphill part) to stop a runaway truck. Shorter, downhill ramps may use stainless-steel nets to catch runaway rigs.
<h2>4 Mountain Highways With Runaway Truck Ramps</h2>
Be careful on the roads listed below. Obey the traffic laws and know where the ramps are placed.
<h3><em>Monteagle Mountain, Tennessee</em></h3>
The treacherous grade up and over Monteagle Mountain has been made famous by both Jerry Reed and Johnny Cash. The eastbound side of I-24 descends 1,161 feet in just over four miles.

At the top of the mountain heading eastbound, you enter a ramp to your right for a mandatory inspection. This is a good thing. If you have any tire, gear or brake issues, you want to know about them before you sail down the 6% grade for those four miles. You also receive information about the conditions and navigation of the section of highway.

Trucks must bear to the right when descending eastbound, but the runaway truck ramps are located on the left side of the road at 1.9 and 3 miles from the summit. This creates a tricky dilemma. The best course of action is to take it super easy coming down the mountain. If you must cross over the lanes to reach either of the ascending runaway ramps, make noise and flash your lights as much as possible to alert drivers in the faster lanes.
<h3><em>Wolf Creek Pass, Colorado</em></h3>
If you drive your rig along Wolf Creek Pass on U.S. Highway 160, expect to see signs from the Colorado DOT warning you to ""Beware the Wolf."" That's because this stretch of road is deceiving. At first, the grade on this high-mountain pass is relatively flat with two lanes. Eventually, the grade increases to over six percent on both sides.

Speed causes most trucking accidents on the western side of Wolf Creek Pass. When the road narrows and the grade increases, inexperienced truckers may not downshift in enough time to slow their rigs. For this reason, there are two runaway truck ramps off the westbound side of Wolf Creek Pass, situated right before the hairpin turn.

The ""Beware the Wolf"" campaign is aimed at encouraging truckers to use the runaway truck ramps. More importantly, all truckers should obey the posted speed limit for truckers on the pass, which is 25 mph. You will not be fined for using the ramps in an emergency. But you will have to meet with the Colorado State Patrol and pay the costs of towing your semi out of the ramp area.
<h3><em>Teton Pass, Wyoming</em></h3>
Wyoming Highway 22 heading east along Teton Pass to Wilson includes grades that approach 9.5 percent from the summit of the pass to the town below. Runaway trucks have been a problem along this stretch of the Pass. Recently, $3.6 million was spent to install an updated crash-arrestor system.

There is a sand-filled runaway truck ramp on the pass heading down to Wilson, but -- like Monteagle's system -- it requires crossing over traffic to reach the sand portion. The new Teton Pass crash arrestor uses a series of eight webbed nets to catch vehicles. A recent crash caught a personal vehicle hauling a trailer using four of the nets.

Steer into the ramp as centered as you can. The arrestor should guide your semi to the webbing to help slow and then stop your truck quickly.
<h3><em>Mount Rose Highway, Nevada</em></h3>
Nevada is another state that's recently invested millions of dollars in upgrading its runaway truck ramps. State Highway 431 heading toward Tahoe into Incline Village is known for its treacherous spots. The grade varies between three and six percent on the descent down to Incline Village.

The previous gravel runaway ramp failed on several occasions, contributing to several deaths, injuries and a home fire. The new ramp was installed in the same spot.

This arrestor on westbound Mount Rose Highway has ample walls on either side to guide you to the pre-tensioned nets. Because around 5,000 vehicles travel this stretch of Highway 431 every day, the new crash arrestor is a welcome safety feature for all drivers.

Here’s how to make the truck cab your home away from home.",90,3,,,,,,,"Arrow Announcements|Resource Center",,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/trucker.jpg,trucker.jpg,"E:\Sites\arrowtruck_com\blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/trucker.jpg",462,trucker,,,,,,,,,,,,,459,"<img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-462"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/trucker-297x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""297"" height=""300"" />When adjusting to a career, everyone wants job satisfaction. It’s no secret that what determines this satisfaction is a person’s ability to find a comfortable balance between work and home life. Although this balancing act is something every working person has to manage, those in the trucking industry are especially affected.
<!--more-->
As a truck driver, you spend long stretches of time away from your bed, family and friends — working away from home is not an easy thing to do. So how can drivers maintain a healthy balance between family time, personal time and working hours? Outlined below are just a few ideas on how to make the truck cab your home away from home.
<h2>1. Keep Up With People by Optimizing Communications</h2>
Out on the road, you’re traveling at speeds upward of 65 mph — carrying freight hundreds of miles across highways. Back at home, life is also moving pretty fast, and you may worry about the people and social opportunities left behind. Fortunately, maintaining a fulfilling social life while on the road is possible.

When you’re stopping for driving breaks, take a moment to send texts to your spouse or family members throughout the day. This will help break up your driving time and give you that feeling of much-needed connection. During scheduled social time, do more than just text people. Make actual phone calls so that you can hear each other’s voices.

Calling will make you feel much closer to the people you talk to. If available, use your phone to Facetime or your laptop to Skype people. If you miss seeing them, then it’s likely that they are missing your face as well.
<h2>2. Find Stability by Keeping a Schedule</h2>
When you sleep and work in the same space, it sometimes feels like you’re constantly working. You may find yourself feeling burned out and in need of some serious rest and relaxation. This is where keeping a regular schedule comes into play.

You’ve already set your working hours, but make sure you’re also scheduling blocks of time during the day for personal activities. Set aside time for the things you enjoy. Keep up with hobbies, work out, catch up on your favorite TV show or read a book.

Consider scheduling a set time for personal communications with friends and family. This will help you keep in touch and ensure that those you want to talk to are available when you are.
<h2>3. Stay Connected by Using Technology</h2>
New technology makes staying connected on the road easier than ever before. Having a reliable cellular network and smartphone will help you keep in touch and make better use of your downtime.

In addition to your phone, an internet connection is an invaluable resource for keeping up with people, staying entertained and maximizing personal time. We live in a world where in-cab Wi-Fi and streaming services can be installed right in your truck cab. That way, all that the web has to offer is readily accessible.

Feel closer to people back home by watching the same show at the same time. That way, it will feel like you’re enjoying it together. If you’re missing family meals, plan on eating at the same time as your family and video chat while you eat. It will be more like having dinner together.

It’s said that you can’t do a good job if your job is all you do. By implementing the strategies discussed and fitting family and personal time into your work schedule, you can feel more connected to the people and things that matter most to you.

"6 Do's and Don'ts of a Truck Stop Diet | Arrow Truck Sales","Creating a balanced diet is one of the most difficult challenges for long-haul truckers. Use these tips to have a healthy diet while on the road.",90,13,,,,,,,"Arrow Announcements|Resource Center",,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/food.jpg,food.jpg,"E:\Sites\arrowtruck_com\blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/food.jpg",469,food,,,,,,,,,,,,,466,"<img class=""wp-image-469 alignright"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/food-300x200.jpg"" alt="""" width=""288"" height=""192"" />Creating a balanced diet is one of the most difficult challenges for <a href=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/docs/index.aspx"">long-haul truckers</a>. While many truckers opt to pack their own meals to avoid the temptations of the fatty, sugary, and high-sodium options found at truck stops, this tactic is not practical or appealing to everyone.<!--more-->

While truck stops have a notoriously bad reputation for being unhealthy, making smart decisions about which truck stop foods you eat and how you eat them can enable you to maintain a satisfying diet on the road.

In this blog, we cover six fundamental do’s and don'ts for when you rely on truck stops as your primary food source.
<ol>
 	<li>
<h2><strong> Do Plan Your Meals According to Your Timetable</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
When you work a traditional shift job, your meals tend to end up being at a specific time each day, usually two to four hours apart. While the hours you keep while on the road may vary dramatically and may include some days that are significantly longer than a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. shift, you should maintain a mealtime regimen.

Plan to have a meal every few hours. This timetable can keep you from grazing on snacks all the way to your unloading point and also ensures that you don't deprive yourself necessary calories. Keep in mind that this strategy may mean that you have some days with more than three meals or with meals at odd times.

When you plan your route, look for stops at appropriate intervals.
<ol start=""2"">
 	<li>
<h2><strong> Don't Hesitate to Adjust Portion Sizes</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
In addition to regular mealtimes, shift work often also dictates portion size. In this conventional working environment, you may sit down for a hearty breakfast, lunch, and dinner as separate, distinct meals.

As a trucker, you may not want or need the portion sizes you would eat at home. We'll talk more about fulfilling your nutritional needs in the next section, but you should also listen to how much food your body seems to want and adjust your meal size accordingly to make it easier to stay on your routine.

You may find it helpful to think ahead about which meal you'll purchase at the next stop. However, you shouldn't hesitate to expand or decrease that meal size slightly if you feel like you should once you've parked.
<ol start=""3"">
 	<li>
<h2><strong> Do Consider Your Nutritional Needs</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
One of the most important rules of surviving on truck stop food is understanding and prioritizing your nutritional needs. Most contemporary truck stops offer a variety of healthy choices that can help you balance your diet, but you have to know your needs first.

As you shop for truck stop food, make a mental list of the categories each food falls into. Include a protein, such as nuts or cheese, and a form of produce, whether fruit or vegetable, with every meal.

Keep in mind that because hauls require you to remain seated for long periods of time, you may not need calorically dense foods at every meal. For example, nuts contain more calories and more fat than most dairy products so even though nuts are a good source of protein, you may not want to eat them as your protein three meals a day.
<ol start=""4"">
 	<li>
<h2><strong> Don't Try to Revolutionize Your Diet All at Once</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
When you decide to eat a more balanced diet at the truck stops you frequent, you may want to change all your habits at once. Many truckers make these changes to lose weight, improve their health, and increase their energy.

However, too many drastic changes can lead to uncomfortable cravings and physical symptoms. Additionally, the more habits you try to break and create at the same time, the harder it will be to keep up with all of them. Instead, choose one or two goals to work on for a month at a time such as eating a fruit with each meal or drinking tea instead of soda.

You may want to discuss any preexisting health conditions you have, such as diabetes, with your doctor before making any significant changes to your diet. Even positive changes can sometimes create dangerous instability in your health if done too quickly.
<ol start=""5"">
 	<li>
<h2><strong> Do Sit Down for Real Meals When Possible</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
Many truck stops have restaurants in addition to miniature grocery store aisles. The process of ordering and eating sitting down can improve digestion and help you make more rational food choices because it eliminates the pressure of needing to get in and out too quickly to find the foods you need.
<ol start=""6"">
 	<li>
<h2><strong> Don't Forget to Stock Up On Meal Options</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
In addition to your planned stops that allow you to pick up a meal or sit down to have one in a truck stop restaurant, you should also plan to stock up for future meals when necessary. For example, if your route will take you through a particularly rural area with no stop options, grab your next meal the stop before.

Use these guidelines to ensure that the truck stops you end up in on your routes provide you with the nutrition you need to stay healthy and comfortable on long hauls.",,"2018-03-23 22:27:26",post,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/2018/03/23/6-dos-donts-truck-stop-diet/,publish,2,ATSBlogIT,itats@arrowtruck.com,,,6-dos-donts-truck-stop-diet,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2018-03-23 22:29:26"

"5 Ways to Deal With Dock Business | Arrow Truck Sales","To become a professional and prosperous carrier, focus your attention on how to meet your needs and your customer's needs at the loading dock.",90,4,,,,,,,"Regulations and Compliance|Resource Center",,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Truck.jpg,Truck.jpg,"E:\Sites\arrowtruck_com\blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Truck.jpg",487,Truck,,,,,,,,,,,,,486,"<img class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-487"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Truck-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""225"" />If you own or work for a new or small trucking company, you know that the loading dock is where business often gets done. It's the spot where the transfer of goods takes place, so the dock is the location where you meet your commitment to customers.<!--more-->

To become a professional and prosperous carrier, focus your attention on how to meet your needs and your customer's needs at the loading dock. Here are five ways to work well at docks.
<h2><strong>1. Know the Drill</strong></h2>
Learn as much as you can about an unknown dock area before you arrive at the destination. When possible, have a printed-paper or screenshot diagram of the loading zones, access roads, and the surrounding area.

Don't trust GPS to always show you the way. Find out where the preferred truck entrance is located on the diagram or from a company contact. When you do this, you won't waste time searching for the correct driveway on arrival.

Online map searches offer another reliable way to visualize facilities where you pick up or drop off loads. With the street-view option, you can locate the delivery access easements on main roads and side streets. You know exactly how the turn-ins look in real life.

Chat with other truckers who've delivered or picked up loads at a facility you've never serviced. Fellow truckers may share important tips, tricks, and contacts to help expedite your dock duties. Share what you know with other truckers, too.
<h2><strong>2. Keep a Dock Log</strong></h2>
After your first visit to a site, jot down any important details about the facility in a dock log. When you return home, enter the dock specifics into your main customer profile for that company.

If you run a small-but-growing trucking business, you may think this step is unnecessary. You can keep track of each dock layout and procedure, right? However, as your business grows, new drivers, dispatchers, and office workers will need information about your customers, too.

When you keep your own database of dock secrets, this information helps your staff serve customers reliably and cuts down on wasted time at loading areas. Future drivers will feel more confident and represent your company well when they know where to go, how to perform their work, and who to contact at the customer's end.
<h2><strong>3. Arrive Prepared</strong></h2>
Use a separate satchel for dock-related supplies and equipment. As you get closer to your destination, move this satchel close to your seat. You can easily grab it to have all of the essentials at your fingertips as soon as you stop at the destination.

Fill your dock bag with any items you may need for your specific dock duties including:
<ul>
 	<li>Protective gloves</li>
 	<li>Flashlights</li>
 	<li>Safety glasses</li>
 	<li>Tools for safety locks</li>
 	<li>Pens for documents</li>
</ul>
The items you choose for your bag will vary depending on your hauling specialty. Hazardous-material carriers need specialized protective gear, while truckers delivering to construction sites need hard hats and safety vests.

As you deliver to more sites, you'll learn the quirks and glitches at each site. For example, a specific dock site may have a problem with mosquitoes in the vicinity. After a visit or two, you’ll know to bring bug repellent for that trip.
<h2><strong>4. Insist on Safety</strong></h2>
Loading docks are hazardous places. When you and the dock staff are in a big hurry, accidents happen. Insist that safety rules are always followed when dock personnel are working with your truck, even if you're behind schedule. Always ensure that proper dock restraints are locked in place before any loading or unloading happens.

Lock your truck cab to avoid any theft up front while you conduct business out back. Any staff entering the trailer's cargo area should be wearing their employee I.D. badge and loading or unloading in a safe manner. If forklifts are in the cargo area, the forklift operator must be careful with speed and with the forks to avoid workplace injuries, product damage, and structural damage to the trailer.

Don't be afraid to report unsafe working conditions, and don't be shy about cutting a dangerous dock from your delivery schedule. Work only with companies that care about your safety so you can be in business for a long time.
<h2><strong>5. Research Detention-Time Prevention</strong></h2>
Facilities sometimes don't do enough to ensure you can get in and out of the loading area in a reasonable amount of time. While some facilities use innovative tools like portable conveyors that go into the trailers for loading and unloading, many smaller facilities have slow, inefficient product-handling procedures.

Time spent detained at facilities costs truckers over <a href=""https://www.trucks.com/2018/02/04/loading-dock-wait-times-cost-truckers/"">one billion dollars</a><u>*</u> per year in combined economic losses. Owner-operators sometimes have to eat these costs.

If you haul independently, come up with your own system to track your detention times at various facilities. Consult with an attorney to determine if you should legally penalize companies for blatant incompetence at their docks.

Pay attention to trucker message boards and trucker-oriented social media to learn about bad players. If truckers start boycotting facilities that take truckers' time for granted, businesses will be forced to tighten up wasteful dock processes. When a dock is run efficiently, let the company representative know how pleased you were with your experience.

"Your First Summer as a Truck Driver | Arrow Truck Sales","Summer driving requires as many precautions as winter does. Learn the steps you need to take to ensure that you weather your first summer as a truck driver.",90,3,,,,,,,"Resource Center",,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Road.png,Road.png,"E:\Sites\arrowtruck_com\blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Road.png",495,Road,,,,,,,,,,,,,493,"<img class=""alignright size-full wp-image-495"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Road.png"" alt="""" width=""297"" height=""199"" />Truck driving offers a consistent income throughout the entire year, regardless of the weather. Most new truck drivers know to expect difficulties as they take to the road during the winter. However, just because summer doesn't threaten black ice and blizzards doesn't mean that summer driving doesn't require specific precautions.

As you anticipate summer long hauls, you should take steps to ensure that you and <a href=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/docs/index.aspx"">your truck</a> are prepared for the challenges of extreme heat and unforgiving direct sunlight for every mile of your route.

In this blog, we discuss the fundamental steps you can take to ensure that you weather your first summer as a truck driver — and every future summer as well — with as few issues as possible.<!--more-->
<h2>Calculate Traffic Into Your Route</h2>
During the summer, roads can become particularly congested. Not only do many individuals and families take road trips to vacation destinations during the warm months, but construction crews repair and expand roadways during this period as well.

Track traffic reports and calculate these delays into your route to prevent late drop-offs.
<h2>Check Your Cooling System</h2>
The last issue you want to deal with during the summer is driving for long periods of time without air conditioning or with an overheated engine. Before the first heat wave strikes, assess your radiator, check your antifreeze levels, and test your cooling system.

You may also want to change your cabin air filter to optimize your air conditioner's performance.
<h2>Choose Appropriate Clothing</h2>
As counterintuitive as it may seem, the best clothing for summertime trucking consists of long sleeves and head coverings. These articles of clothing reduce your risk of serious sunburns and protect you from the worst of the heat transfer through your windows and windshield.
<h2>Inspect Your Tires</h2>
Extreme heat encourages blowouts, especially in improperly inflated or worn-out tires. Before you begin summertime driving, check your tire tread depth to ensure that you have adequate traction and a lower risk of flats. Check your tire pressure regularly during the summer as well.
<h2>Make a Habit of Checking the Weather</h2>
While summer may not have the vicious snow, sleet, and hail of winter, summer storms can come on quickly. Many of these serious storms occur when cold fronts meet warm air. This occurrence is one of the major factors in tornado formation especially.

In addition to tracking traffic patterns, make a habit of checking weather forecasts for flood, lightning storm, and tornado advisories that may affect your safety on the road.
<h2>Pack Plenty of Water</h2>
You may assume that because you are less physically active on a long haul that you don't need to stay as hydrated. However, because of the high temperatures and direct sunlight of summer conditions, dehydration can become a serious issue very quickly. Intense dehydration could even make it unsafe for you to drive.

Pack plenty of water in addition to your favorite on-the-road beverages. Remember, soda can make you more dehydrated, not less. Additionally, you should place large bottles of water in your cab for emergencies.
<h2>Pop Your Hood</h2>
In addition to your cooling systems and tires, you should also check and service the primary systems in your engine. Pay particular attention to your battery, belts, and hoses because these components tend to be most vulnerable to excessive heat.

Be sure to change your oil and top off your fluids before your first summertime long haul as well.
<h2>Stock Up on Sunscreen</h2>
Even if you wear long sleeves and a hat every day that you're on the road, your face and neck can still be exposed to bright sunlight for hours at a time. Choose a high SPF sunscreen and apply this protection every few hours while you drive in order to prevent sunburns.

Even minor sunburns can contribute to dehydration and be highly uncomfortable. Additionally, serious sunburns can blister and require professional medical care that may impede your ability to operate your truck.
<h2>Update Your Roadside Emergency Kit</h2>
You likely already have a roadside emergency kit that includes flares, cones, and other essentials. Your emergency summertime water supply is technically part of this kit as well. However, you shouldn't consider your kit complete without cooling items that you can use if you're stranded in a hot area.

These items may include break-and-use cold compresses, spray bottles, and a personal fan. You may also want to consider filling a cooler with ice and reusable compresses to keep your water cold and provide a little extra cooling if necessary while you're on the road.

Follow the practices outlined above to ensure that you have the equipment you'll need and that you have completed appropriate maintenance services before temperatures begin to climb. You may also want to ask more experienced truck drivers for their personal advice about addressing summer driving challenges. With proper preparation, you can make your summer drives as stress-free as possible.

"Prevent Toll Costs From Taking a Toll | Arrow Truck Sales","For long-haul truckers, toll roads can significantly shift profit margins.

The National Conference of State Legislators (NCSL) most recent report on tolling showed that more than half of the United States — 33 states total, reaching from Alaska to Florida — have active tolling facilities. Another 9 states, including Oregon, New Mexico, and Tennessee have laws that authorize tolling despite having no current facilities.<!--more-->

Additionally, according to The Fiscal Times, failing infrastructure and rising road maintenance costs in 2018 have led many states, like Florida, to increase the number of toll roads within their borders. Some states with no tolling facilities, like Connecticut, have also begun discussions about implementing new tolls in the future.

Unfortunately for truck drivers, the widespread presence of toll roads in the U.S. results in increased expenses that cannot be passed on to customers. In this blog, we provide you with best practices to help minimize the impact of toll costs on your profits.
<h2>Calculate Your Trip Tolls</h2>
You can predict the exact amount of some of your trucking expenses, such as your vehicle monthly payment if your <a href=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/docs/index.aspx"">buying your semi-truck</a>. Your fuel, food, and of course toll costs are more unpredictable, especially because toll rates change throughout the day based on traffic conditions.

However, you can use toll maps and other technology to calculate your approximate costs. Websites like TruckRouter and mobile apps like Tollsmart Toll Calculator can help you anticipate the costs of a specific route before you start your engine.
<h2>Invest in the Right Electronic Pass</h2>
One of the most frustrating realities of toll roads in the United States is the fact that the same forms of payment are not universally accepted — not even cash! Many new truck drivers find themselves paying additional fees because they bring cash to pay tolls in states with no cash toll roads or they have incompatible electronic passes.

When you purchase an electronic pass, check that it covers the states you will pass through. The most common passes are as follows:
<ul>
 	<li><em>Bestpass</em> — a pass accepted in many states and a service intended to simplify tolling specifically for truckers by including all tolls as a single invoice</li>
 	<li><em>E-ZPass</em> — valid in 16 Midwestern and Eastern states</li>
 	<li><em>FasTrak</em> — works at most bridge and road toll facilities in California</li>
 	<li><em>SunPass</em> — primarily used in Florida but is also accepted in Georgia and North Carolina</li>
 	<li><em>TxTag</em> — works at all toll facilities in Texas</li>
</ul>
Do your research when deciding how best to pay your tolls. Unfortunately, you still can’t get an electronic pass that will work in all states despite legislation passed in 2012 by the U.S. Congress that requires the country’s tolling agencies to make their electronic toll collection systems interoperable.
<h2>Keep Precise Documentation</h2>
As a truck driver, you have a responsibility to track your expenses, especially if you are an owner-operator and handle your taxes on your own. You should be particularly thorough when documenting toll expenses because deducting toll costs on your taxes can be complicated.

Generally, toll costs apply to taxes in the following ways:
<ul>
 	<li>Any tolls you pay while using your truck for commuting or personal purposes are not tax deductible</li>
 	<li>Toll miles are subject to fuel taxes under your International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA) report except for any tax-exempt miles traveled on the Massachusetts Turnpike</li>
 	<li>Tolls you pay while on taxable toll roads should be included on your taxes</li>
 	<li>Tolls you pay while on toll roads with highway use taxes (HUT), like the New York State Thruway, cannot be included with your taxable toll costs</li>
</ul>
Your documentation should include all physical receipts or invoices you receive that show toll payments. You may also decide to log your toll activity, especially if you frequently travel in states with tricky taxable and non-taxable miles laws.
<h2>Weigh the Costs of Route Alternatives</h2>
In some cases, you may simply decide to avoid tolls altogether and risk the delays caused by additional traffic. However, you should carefully weigh the pros and cons of your route options before you get on the road.

In some states, avoiding tolls means taking side roads that are not passable to trucks. In less extreme cases, staying off toll roads could delay your next drop-off or pickup and change your entire schedule. Use the mapping resources discussed in the first section to compare different toll roads and free roads directly so you can make an informed decision.

In addition to the tips listed in this blog, you may also want to discuss your exact planned routes with more experienced truck drivers for recommendations specific to the areas you'll drive through. Use the guidelines discussed in this blog to ensure that the toll that toll roads may take on your upcoming trucking routes is as minimal as possible.",,"2018-06-20 19:02:26",post,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/2018/06/20/prevent-toll-costs-taking-toll/,publish,1,ATSBlogM,schaiyote@arrowtruck.com,,,prevent-toll-costs-taking-toll,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2018-06-20 19:05:22"
"12 Tools No Trucker Should Be Without | Arrow Truck Sales","Whether you find yourself stranded by the side of the road or at a truck stop, learn which tools are necessary to get your truck back on the road.",90,13,,,,,,,"Arrow Announcements",,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/needed-tools.jpg,needed-tools.jpg,"E:\Sites\arrowtruck_com\blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/needed-tools.jpg",521,needed-tools,,,,,,,,,,,,,516,"<img class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-521"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/needed-tools-300x223.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""223"" />As a long-haul trucker, it pays to be prepared for just about anything that happens on the open road. Whether you find yourself stranded by the side of the road or at a truck stop, you want to have the tools necessary to get your truck back on the road. Here are a few tools that should be a mainstay in your rig.<!--more-->
<h2>1. First Aid Kit</h2>
A good first aid kit is an absolute must-have item for any trucker. If you get a cut or scrape while on the open road, pulling in to the next pharmacy you see might not be an option. The ideal first aid kit should come with plenty of dressings, bandages, gauze pads, antiseptic wipes, and ointments. Other tools that can come in handy in your first aid kit include tweezers, scissors, non-latex gloves, and an oral thermometer.
<h2>2. Basic Hand Tool Kit</h2>
Having a basic set of box wrenches and a ratchet wrench with both standard and metric sockets can come in handy for just about any emergency repair or quick fix. Your hand toolkit should also come with an assortment of screwdrivers, hex keys, and pliers.
<h2>3. Pocket Knife of Multitool</h2>
Pocket knives or multitools can come in handy for just about any task, whether it's opening up a plastic package or trimming a coolant hose. When choosing a pocket knife, look for one that offers a comfortable handle, a high-quality blade, and a good warranty.
<h2>4. Work Gloves</h2>
You only get one pair of hands, so it's worth protecting them from the scrapes, heat, and grease buildup that often comes with a typical truck repair. A good pair of mechanic's work gloves can save your hands some wear and tear.

These gloves come in a variety of designs and colors, but consider getting gloves with fluorescent or reflective features for added nighttime visibility. You should also invest in an extra pair or two just in case you misplace your original pair.
<h2>5. Jump Starter</h2>
While a good set of jumper cables can come in handy, you might not always have someone who can help give you a jump start. That's where the portable jump starter comes in. A heavy-duty jump starter can give your truck's batteries enough of a boost to start your truck and get back on the road again.
<h2>6. Tire Air Gauge</h2>
A tire air gauge is yet another must-have tool that no trucker should be without. When shopping around for a tire air gauge, choose one that's able to read up to 160 psi since most truck tire pressures range from 100 psi to 120 psi. Again, buy quality...you won't regret it.
<h2>7. Rechargeable Headlamp</h2>
Working in the dead of night without the right lighting is not only a pain but also potentially dangerous. When you need both hands for a repair, using an ordinary handheld flashlight can make that repair much harder. A high-quality rechargeable head-mounted light can take all of the frustration out your nighttime repair, leaving your hands free to tackle your repair.

When choosing rechargeable headlamp, be sure to choose one with a long-lasting LED and settings for a high beam, low beam, and strobe function. Don't forget to make sure it includes a 12-volt car charger and/or USB charging cable for convenience.
<h2>8. Tire Thumper</h2>
A tire thumper offers a faster but less scientific way to check your tire pressures. When given a good whack, truck tires make a distinctive sound when aired up at the correct pressure. If you're pressed for time, you can use your tire thumper to quickly check all of the tires on your truck without missing a beat. You can also use your tire thumper as a self-defense weapon, which could come in handy when making repairs in dark, isolated areas.
<h2>9. Multimeter</h2>
Being able to diagnose electrical problems on the side of the road can help get you back on the road faster. You can use your trusty pocket multimeter to track down battery drains and electrical shorts. When choosing a multimeter, make sure it's able to read continuity and resistance as well as voltage and current.
<h2>10. Laser Infrared Temperature Gun</h2>
A laser infrared temperature gun can come in handy for checking components that you suspect are overheating. For instance, you can safely check tire and wheel bearing temperatures from a distance. When you're not on the road, you can also use it to check meat temperatures on your barbecue grill, among other things.
<h2>11. Fuel Filter Wrench</h2>
If you're stuck on the side of the road due to a clogged fuel filter, having a fuel filter wrench on hand can help cut out the need for a service truck dispatch. Just make sure your fuel filter wrench is large enough to handle the filters your truck uses.
<h2><strong>12. Vise Grips</strong></h2>
You never know when you'll need a pair of vise grips. A pair of locking vise grips can help temporarily pinch off leaking lines and provide enough grip to break stubborn nuts and bolts, among other uses.

Having a well-stocked toolbox is just one of the ways to prepare for your next journey. You also need the right truck.

"What It Takes to Be a Hazmat-Certified Driver | Arrow Truck Sales","Hazmat certification can create opportunities that lead to better job prospects and higher income. Learn about the requirements and endorsements you need.",30,13,,,,,,,"Arrow Announcements",,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/picttt.jpg,picttt.jpg,"E:\Sites\arrowtruck_com\blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/picttt.jpg",528,picttt,,,,,,,,,,,,,527,"<img src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/picttt-300x200.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""200"" class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-528"" /><br>
Every day, professional truck drivers are tasked with hauling a wide variety of goods and materials throughout the country. These goods run the gamut from raw and unfinished materials to produce, appliances, electronics, livestock, machinery, and motorized vehicles. Nearly every product used by the average public has been entrusted in the careful hands of a long-haul trucker at some point.<!--more-->

As a truck driver, companies and customers rely on you to safely deliver these and other goods to their proper destinations. But when it comes to transporting loads that could potentially be hazardous to others on the road, it's up to the hazmat-certified driver to deliver those loads safely. Becoming a hazmat-certified driver can be a rewarding and challenging career move that tests your skills.

Adding hazmat certification to your list of truck driving skills and qualifications can create new opportunities that lead to better job prospects and increased income. The following talks about the various requirements and endorsements needed to become a hazmat-certified driver.
<h2>Requirements</h2>
To become a hazmat-certified driver, you'll need to add a hazmat endorsement to your commercial driver's license. Without it, you won't be able to haul explosives, gases, combustible liquids, and other materials deemed hazardous. Having a valid CDL along with valid proof of your legal status and residence will cover the basics for a hazmat endorsement.

You must also complete the Transportation Security Administration's threat-assessment screening in accordance with the USA Patriot Act before continuing with your hazmat certification. This process is similar to an employer's background check, and it can take up to 45 days to receive proof of clearance.

You'll also need to undergo a medical examination along with an eye exam as part of your hazmat endorsement application.

Becoming a hazmat-certified driver also requires having a clean record. Having a felony conviction on your criminal record can limit some of your trucking opportunities, including the ability to receive a hazmat endorsement. If you were recently convicted of a misdemeanor offense or have had your record recently expunged, you may still qualify for a hazmat endorsement.
<h2>Tests</h2>
In addition to meeting the basic requirements for hazmat certification, you'll also need to take your state's hazmat endorsement test. Your state's hazmat endorsement test will typically consist of 30 questions on various aspects of hazardous material transport, including proper placard usage, driving and parking rules, driver responsibilities, and the proper way to handle emergencies involving hazardous materials.

To increase your likelihood of achieving a passing grade, you should brush up on your hazardous materials knowledge before taking the hazmat endorsement test. Taking an online practice test gives you an opportunity to become familiar with some of the questions that'll be featured in the real test.

Keep in mind that some companies may compensate you for the cost of obtaining your hazmat endorsement, as well as the cost of your TSA screening. Your company may also pick up the tab for endorsement renewals and additional training.
<h2>Additional Endorsements</h2>
Hazardous materials can come in all shapes and forms. However, the majority of hazardous materials you'll transport will likely be stored in tankers. Gasoline, various oils, and pressurized gases are among the numerous hazardous materials that rely on tanker transport. If you haven't already obtained a tanker endorsement on your CDL, you'll need it to legally haul tankers containing hazardous materials.

The good news is that you can obtain your tanker endorsement at the same time as your hazmat endorsement. However, you'll still need to take separate tests for your hazmat and tanker endorsements.

Once you've passed both tests, you may notice an ""X"" endorsement on your CDL instead of the ""H"" hazmat endorsement you were expecting. The ""X"" endorsement covers both hazmat and tanker endorsements, so you won't have to worry about not having the right endorsements listed on your CDL.

If you already have an ""N"" tanker endorsement, your state will convert it into an ""X"" endorsement once you've earned your hazmat endorsement.
<h2>Training</h2>
If you're driving for a trucking company, you may receive additional hazmat training from your employer during or after you've obtained your hazmat endorsement. The U.S. Department of Transportation requires employers to provide training for employees who are new to transporting hazardous materials, as well as recurring training for experienced employees.

During your training, you'll become more familiar with the identification, handling, and transport of hazardous materials. You'll also receive training for handling certain types of hazardous shipments, including those that require extra security measures. The DOT requires trucking companies to retrain their hazmat-certified drivers every three years and maintain records regarding their training.

In some cases, you may be paired with a supervisor who's already hazmat certified until you learn the ropes. If you're an owner-operator, the DOT allows for self-training and testing as long as it conforms to the DOT's training requirements.

"Driving Your Rig in Wildfire Zones | Arrow Truck Sales","Wildfires pose a serious hazard to professional truckers. Stay safe when driving your rig in wildfire conditions by following these five best practices.",90,,,,,,,,"Arrow Announcements|Uncategorized",,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/fire.jpg,fire.jpg,"E:\Sites\arrowtruck_com\blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/fire.jpg",535,fire,,,,,,,,,,,,,533,"<img class=""alignright size-medium wp-image-535"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/fire-300x200.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""200"" />Wildfires are raging in California, Oregon, and Washington State. Last year, fires ravaged portions of Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. Wildfires pose a serious hazard to professional truckers who must travel in fire-prone areas. Stay safe when driving your rig in wildfire conditions by following these five best practices.<!--more-->

&nbsp;
<ol>
 	<li>
<h2><strong> Stay Aware of Current Conditions</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
Wildfires grow and spread rapidly. A fire-free stretch of highway may be clear one minute and covered in embers and smoke five minutes later. During wildfires, officials close highways and other through-roads with little or no warning.

When traveling in and around wildfire areas, find several up-to-the-minute sources of information on road and visibility conditions. Social media sites, trucker apps, CB communication, and dispatcher updates offer real-time data on the road conditions ahead.

Some states host live traffic info on local FM or AM radio frequencies. Other states place informative signs over the highways to keep drivers current on road delays and hazards. Use all of the tools at your disposal to stay away from dangerous, fiery roads.

&nbsp;
<ol start=""2"">
 	<li>
<h2><strong> Ensure Your Rig Is Spark-Free</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
When fire risk is high, a single spark can set the roadside ablaze. Go over your rig to ensure it has no dragging tow chains or other components that could produce sparks from contact with the road.

Don't toss cigarette butts out the window ever. Keep a bag for litter close at hand inside your truck, so paper and other debris don't accidentally fly out of a window. Paper debris on the roadside can be set afire when a careless cigarette butt or spark lands on the trash.

&nbsp;
<ol start=""3"">
 	<li>
<h2><strong> Understand Suspended Trucking Rules</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
In August 2018, the U.S. Department of Transportation suspended some federal trucking regulations in response to the states of emergency declared in Western wildfire areas. If you're hauling support materials or equipment intended for the firefighting effort, you're exempt from hours-of-service and some other rules during the emergency period.

The suspended rules allow you to:
<ul>
 	<li>Get expedited truck inspections at weigh stations</li>
 	<li>Exceed 24-hour mileage limits</li>
 	<li>Forego tracking of driving times</li>
 	<li>Receive exemptions for load-securement standards</li>
</ul>
The suspended rules do not suspend any rules concerning substance abuse, faulty tires, or driver-documentation requirements. You must also still comply with size and weight requirements and hazardous-material precautions.

Be prepared to tell law enforcement, motor carriers, and other officials that you're hauling a load destined for the firefighting efforts. Be ready to show proof of your hauling route, too.

&nbsp;
<ol start=""4"">
 	<li>
<h2><strong> Prepare for Delays and Evacuations</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
During fire and heavy smoke conditions, you may have to wait for long periods on highways and other roads as traffic and debris are cleared. Before entering areas where wildfires are present, check your fuel gauge and top off other vital fluids.

Have drinks, snacks, and other necessities available in case your delay makes you miss a meal. Keeping hydrated and well-fed will help you stay alert to traffic and fire conditions.

Evacuation may be necessary if flames are at risk of engulfing your truck. Truckers have had to abandon rigs in California and Colorado this fire season. When ordered to evacuate your truck, do so as soon as possible to save your life. No matter how valuable your rig is, your life is priceless.

Have a go-bag ready for an evacuation. A backpack or duffel bag is easy to carry in an emergency.

Inside the evacuation bag, place:
<ul>
 	<li>Change of clothes and underwear</li>
 	<li>Clean pair of shoes</li>
 	<li>Extra cash</li>
 	<li>Medications and toiletries</li>
 	<li>Bottled water and snacks</li>
 	<li>Contact information</li>
</ul>
It's never easy to abandon a rig when disaster looms. However, when you have a bag ready to go, all you have to do is throw your phone, keys, and documentation inside, and you can escape fast. You won't waste time looking for necessities while the flames are licking at your truck.

&nbsp;
<ol start=""5"">
 	<li>
<h2><strong> Have Resources at Hand to Find Alternate Routes</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
Even when roads and highways are clear near wildfire zones, traffic can back up for miles. Low visibility, nearby evacuations, and wildfires burning on the road a few miles ahead are all causes of road delays.

As of September 7, the only interstate linking California and Oregon is closed along a 45-mile stretch of road due to the effects from the 22,000-acre Delta Fire. Officials are unsure when the important commercial-truck route will reopen. This scenario will replay every time fires advance and spread over key transport routes.

Have backup travel plans in mind to keep you moving when roads are suddenly closed. Google maps, state departments of transportation, and some local law enforcement agencies have detour information available online.

Your GPS device is another source where you'll find alternate routes to your delivery address. Good old-fashioned paper maps and atlases have details about back roads and state highways that are open for travel.

"Important Hurricane Safety Tips for Truckers | Arrow Truck Sales","If you must drive your truck in the Eastern U.S. during hurricane season, read these tips so you can stay safe during and after storms.",90,3,,,,,,,"Resource Center",,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hurricane.jpg,hurricane.jpg,"E:\Sites\arrowtruck_com\blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hurricane.jpg",541,hurricane,,,,,,,,,,,,,539,"<img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-541"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/hurricane-300x187.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""187"" />Hurricane season in the United States Atlantic and Gulf coasts generally begin in June and ends around November. If you must drive your truck in states in the Eastern U.S. or along the Gulf Coast, be aware of hurricane-related dangers during and after storms.

Here's what truckers should know about hurricane safety.<!--more-->
<h2>Stay Informed to Stay Safe</h2>
During hurricane season, your weather awareness can save your life. When you know where tropical storms and hurricanes will strike next, you can adjust your route to avoid the high winds and flooding that hurricanes produce. Always take the time to check weather forecasts and alerts for the areas where you're driving.

Find weather sites that are easy to access on your phone or another device so you can quickly check the status of impending weather events in your location. A National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) weather radio is a worthwhile investment if you routinely travel in hurricane-prone areas.

Understand that a flash-flood or tornado <em>watch</em> means that weather conditions may cause flooding or destructive winds. A flash-flood or tornado <em>warning</em> means that flooding or funnel clouds have been spotted in a specific location.
<h2>Check With State DOT Sites for Road Closings</h2>
Know how to find the websites for individual state departments of transportation (DOTs). State DOT websites often provide more accurate information about road conditions than dispatchers and traffic maps can provide. DOT websites offer detailed descriptions of the highway and surface street closures in the state.

Check in with DOT websites throughout the day when you're driving in a risky state. You'll learn up-to-date facts about travel routes and road closures to plan the safest routes.
<h2>Heed the Barriers and Signs</h2>
Safety officials don't install barriers across roadways to make your delivery late. They place warning signs and barriers on roads that lead to dangerous flooding. No matter how tall or heavy your truck is, if you ignore a warning sign and drive around a barrier or past a warning sign, you put yourself, your truck, and your cargo at risk.

It only takes a few feet of fast-moving water to sweep a truck into deeper waters. Barriers and warning signs should always be heeded for this reason.

Even if you know that another trucker recently passed without incident down a flooded road, a few minutes later, that same road may be fully engulfed in high water. Don't trust word-of-mouth stories about road safety or ignore official warnings and road closures.

Floodwaters can cause:
<ul>
 	<li>Holes and buckling of roads</li>
 	<li>Sharp, tire-slashing debris in water</li>
 	<li>Thick mud and silt on roadways</li>
 	<li>The collapse of bridges and overpasses</li>
 	<li>Downed power lines</li>
</ul>
Recently, a trucker in South Carolina drove over a bridge that collapsed under their semi due to Florence-related flooding. The blacktop on the bridge eroded in pieces from the pressure of rushing flood waters. The driver made it out safely, but their experience highlights the fact that you can't see what's under the water when a road is flooded.
<h2>Drive Slowly and Carefully in Flooded Areas</h2>
When you have no warning that the road ahead is flooded, use your best judgment to determine if you can continue down the road or not. Even low-level flooding can cause your truck to hydroplane, get stuck, or suffer mechanical damage.

If possible, watch other drivers pass through a flooded area to see how their vehicles respond. If you decide to proceed, don't follow closely behind another vehicle on a flooded road. Give the vehicle ahead some room, so you avoid colliding if the other driver gets stuck or stops dead in a panic.

Proceed slowly into a flooded area, but not so slowly that you get stuck yourself. Maintain a constant, moderate speed so you don't create high waves, lose steering control, or lessen other drivers' visibility. To maintain traction, avoid using your engine brake on steep, flooded roads.

Keep your eye out for people and debris in flooded sections of road. If you encounter a flooded section on a lonely stretch of road after nightfall, turn around and find a safer route to reach your destination.
<h2>Prepare for High Winds</h2>
Storm-force winds are a serious hazard for tall semis and trailers. To maintain control in high-wind situations, keep both hands on the wheel and remain on high alert. Remember that other truckers and drivers are struggling against the wind, too.

The most unsafe places during high winds include:
<ul>
 	<li>Open, exposed roads</li>
 	<li>Highway overpasses</li>
 	<li>Bridges</li>
 	<li>Mountain passes</li>
 	<li>Tunnels</li>
</ul>
If you're pulling a dry van or a reefer in high winds, you're at a greater risk of flipping or wrecking your rig in the risky road conditions listed above. Tornadoes are sometimes spawned by high winds, too. If you find yourself in a hazardous high-wind situation or facing an oncoming funnel cloud, find a safe space to pull over and wait out the dangerous conditions.

<h1>The Facts of Buying a Used Truck</h1>
There are plenty of articles and blogs on the internet today that talk about the financial advantages of buying a used versus new heavy duty truck. Used equipment has a lower purchase cost, no F.E.T. tax, lower total depreciation cost, and higher insurance rates. For some, buying a new $100k plus vehicle is simply not affordable and buying used is definitely a worthwhile consideration. However, those buyers must set proper and realist expectations. So here are some honest facts regarding buying used equipment. <!--more-->

<strong>Used Trucks Are Used Trucks </strong>

That's why generally they cost less than half the price of a new unit. So while they may look new, they are still used. And even though used trucks can cost a lot of money, they cannot be made into a new truck again. Don't expect perfection. It may have dings, dents, scratches, scars, and wear, but it still has productive business value. There is still a good portion of its useful life remaining and it has the potential of earning you money.

When shopping for equipment for your business, just remember that ""pre-owned, nearly new, previously owned, late-model, fleet-buy and certified are still terms used to describe used vehicles. While there may be slight differences, they still had a previous owner and maybe more than one.

<strong>What to Expect When Buying Used Equipment</strong>

While used trucks can offer excellent value, the trucks and their components cannot be expected to have the same useful lifespan they had when they were new. If you expect the used truck you purchase to be perfect, you will likely be disappointed. If you expect it to perform like a brand new truck, again, you are likely going to be disappointed. However, you will most likely get into a truck while staying within your budget. There are definite trade-offs to consider, but ultimately the decision can be a cost-effective one.

One of the most common mistakes a first-time used truck buyer makes is based upon their overexpectations. When you operate a used truck (or even a new truck) on a day-to-day basis, you must have funds available and/or put aside a portion of each paycheck to cover future repairs and unexpected expenses.  If you do not do this, then your business is likely to fail. The amount of funds you'll need is based upon a number of factors, like age of truck, mileage, how you drive it, how often you perform Preventative Maintenance and other variables.

OEM truck manufacturers have made impressive strides in the overall quality of the trucks they build today. There's improved fuel economy, safety, comfort and they last longer. The definition of a high-mileage unit is considerably higher than it has been in the past. That's an article for another day.

<strong>Maximizing Your Purchase…Minimizing Your Exposure</strong>

So you've found the right used truck at the right price that will handle your business application. But you're still thinking ""It's Used!"" The most important thing is to be aware of the facts.

When you buy any piece of equipment, you are ultimately responsible for the cost of maintenance and repairs in one form or another. With used equipment, it's essential that you be a smart, informed buyer and know what you will be responsible for. The best place to start is asking exactly what is covered under any warranty and for how long.

Most reputable used truck dealers thoroughly inspect their trucks, sometimes (and preferably) by a third party. They are then put through a reconditioning process to provide the buyer with the good, dependable road-ready truck.

Some trucks are sold as-is"" which means you are responsible for all repair costs once you take delivery. Some used trucks come with a standard warranty may be provided free-of-charge by the used truck dealer. Extended warranties on most components are available for purchase. So no matter is what type of warranty you are getting, make sure you understand what's covered and for how long. Other than the written warranty available on the truck – and an extended warranty if purchased by the customer – there is no other expressed or implied guarantee. Read the warranty! Don't expect anything to be covered that is not in your written warranty.

<strong>Where You Buy Is As Important As What You Buy</strong>

Finally, make sure you purchase your used truck from a reputable and established dealer with an established history of satisfied customers. Make sure they stand behind the trucks they sell. But even the best, most thoroughly reconditioned used truck may break down as soon as you get it on the road. If that happens, make sure you know who to call to rectify the problem. Have your written warranty documentation with you at all times. Once you take delivery, you become responsible for all the repairs required on your truck not covered in writing.

But for truck drivers, heading into a snowstorm at the helm of their semi-truck for the first time can be an unnerving experience. <!--more-->Even veteran drivers may have second thoughts about driving when severe winter weather strikes.

No matter where you are in your driving experience, having winter weather driving skills is an absolute must. Here are a few tips that can help keep you rolling this winter.
<h2>1. Be Prepared</h2>
Anything can happen when you're out on the open road — more so when you face near-whiteout blizzard conditions. In addition to having your first-aid kit on hand, you'll also want the following tools and supplies in your truck just in case:
<ul>
 	<li>A good-quality windshield scraper for removing slush and ice buildup</li>
 	<li>Jumper cables or a reliable battery charger for reviving weak or dead batteries</li>
 	<li>Traction mats, tire chains, and sand for added traction on icy or slippery roads</li>
 	<li>Extra blankets in case you need to spend the night hunkered down in the berth</li>
 	<li>Extra food and water for extended layovers</li>
 	<li>Extra gloves, extra hats, and a warm coat</li>
</ul>
Also, make sure you depart for your destination with your fuel tanks filled up. If a severe snowstorm stops your progress, you'll at least have enough fuel to keep your cab warm and your truck at operating temperature.
<h2>2. Drive Slow and Steady</h2>
Excessive speed is an all-too-common cause of serious vehicle accidents, including those involving semi-trucks. Traveling at high speeds on snow- and ice-covered roads increases the probability of hydroplaning on slush and ice, robbing your truck's tires of the traction they provide. Speeding can make your vehicle more prone to losing control and jackknifing in snowy weather. Instead, keep your speed at a safe yet reasonable rate.

In addition to slowing down when confronted with severe winter weather conditions, you should avoid making sharp, sudden movements when turning the steering wheel or while you accelerate or brake. These sharp movements can cause you to lose control of your truck on snow and ice. Always practice firm yet fluid movements whenever you steer, accelerate, or brake.
<h2>3. Look Out for Black Ice</h2>
The most dangerous hazards are often the ones you don't see. What at first glance seems like a wet road may actually be a thin, transparent layer of ice known as black ice. Black ice is a dangerous hazard that often forms at near-freezing temperatures, adding an extra element of danger to an already dangerous journey for many truckers.

Spotting black ice can be exceptionally difficult, but you can do a couple of things to protect yourself and others on the open road:
<ul>
 	<li>Exercise caution when approaching bridges and highway overpasses. Black ice often forms on elevated structures long before forming elsewhere. Bridges and overpasses that haven't been treated with road salt or sand are especially vulnerable.</li>
 	<li>Check for ice buildup on your truck's antennae or mirror arms. Ice formation at these extremities can be a sign of black ice buildup elsewhere.</li>
 	<li>Check the water spray from tires on other vehicles in front of you. This spray will quickly stop when another vehicle rolls over a patch of black ice.</li>
 	<li>Know when black ice is likely to form. Sunrise and sunset are prime times for black ice formation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Avoid the Convoy</h2>
Wanting a little company when you're out on the open road is natural, even if it's in the form of a group of trucks running in a tight pack. But running in a pack during severe winter weather conditions can be less safe than traveling alone. Your stopping distances are only as good as the truck in front of you, and being boxed in by other trucks can limit your visibility as well as your evasive options. Instead, break away from the pack and maintain a safe distance between your truck and other vehicles on the road.
<h2>5. Avoid Using Your Jake Brake</h2>
Many truck drivers prefer leaving their exhaust or ""jake"" brake on to minimize brake usage, usually on steep slopes. Unfortunately, using your jake brake on an icy or slippery road could cause your semi-truck to lose control. Instead of relying on jake braking, simply downshift and slow down to maintain safe speeds.
<h2>6. Don't Take Unnecessary Risks</h2>
Even when you're running on a tight schedule, some risks simply aren't worth taking. If weather conditions take a turn for the worse and you no longer feel safe enough to keep driving, pull over at the next safe stop and wait the snowstorm out. Don't pull over on the shoulder unless doing so is absolutely necessary. Instead, slowly make your way to the nearest truck stop, restaurant, or designated rest area for truck drivers.

Safety must always come first when you're at the wheel of your semi-truck.

Well-placed, well-maintained mirrors can make the difference between a secure, successful delivery and a nightmare driving experience. Manage your truck mirrors by following these tips.<!--more-->
<h2>Know the Laws Covering Mirrors</h2>
Each state has its own rules regarding the number and placement of mirrors on semis and other vehicles that tow trailers or have limited visibility. Many states, including Georgia, Colorado, Illinois, and Kentucky, have laws that require one or two mirrors be installed that reflect a rear view of the road for at least 200 feet behind the rig.

Most states expect drivers to install extra mirrors when the view from the windshield-based rearview mirror is obstructed. Some states specify the type of mirrors truckers should install, while other states leave it up to the trucker to install mirrors that increase the visibility behind their rigs.

In Pennsylvania, the law states that your mirrors may extend only 6 inches past the width of the rig or load. Consider purchasing folding mirrors if you regularly drive through Pennsylvania.

Keep up to date with mirror laws in every state where you drive your truck. You'll be safer, and your mirrors will pass state inspections.
<h2>Add More Mirrors for Added Safety</h2>
More mirrors mean more visibility, so add as many mirrors as you can to increase your view around your rig. Flat or plane-style left and right side mirrors are standard primary mirrors for semis, but you can install other mirrors that offer wider views of traffic and nearby obstacles.

Types of truck mirrors available include the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Extended-length planar mirrors for wide loads</li>
 	<li>Convex side mirrors</li>
 	<li>Fender-mounted mirrors</li>
 	<li>Hood-mounted mirrors</li>
 	<li>Look-down or passenger-side mirrors</li>
</ul>
Convex side mirrors are normally mounted just below the planar side mirrors on semis. Hood-mounted and fender-mounted mirrors are often convex mirrors with deep curves to help truckers when changing lanes and backing into spaces.

Look-down mirrors are mounted at the top of the passenger-side windows on large trucks. The look-down mirror helps you visualize traffic and obstacles on your right side and can help you view the blind spot in adjacent right-hand lanes.
<h2>Adjust Your Truck Mirrors Properly</h2>
Adjusting semi-truck mirrors is not a one-time task you can forget about after the job is done. Check and adjust your mirrors during every pre-trip inspection. Variances in load widths can change the view mirrors offer, and high winds or other disruptions can cause mirrors to move out of proper adjustment.

Adjust your mirrors when the truck and trailer are parked straight and in alignment. Sit in the driver's seat in your usual driving position to check your view in your primary mirrors. Get out of your truck and move the primary mirrors until the inside edges of the mirrors give you a clear view of the back edges of the trailer. Take the time to make sure you have reduced all blind spots.

Next, adjust the convex mirrors below your primary mirrors. Convex mirrors should be adjusted until they show the same view of the edges of the trailer that primary mirrors show.

Hood- and fender-mounted mirrors normally don't require adjustment, since they're permanently mounted to the hood or fender. Adjust look-down mirrors so that they are aimed at your right-side blind spot.
<h2>Inspect and Maintain Mirrors Often</h2>
Before, during, and after trips, inspect all of your mirrors for proper operation and condition. Check the durability of mirror attachments and fasteners, and tighten any loose or wobbling mirrors. Improperly secured mirrors will vibrate when you drive down the highway, which will limit the clarity and detail in the reflection you see.

Check mirrors for the following additional issues:
<ul>
 	<li>Stickers or labels on surfaces</li>
 	<li>Mud, bird droppings, and dirt</li>
 	<li>Cracks and chips</li>
 	<li>Loose glass</li>
 	<li>Damage to frames and fasteners</li>
</ul>
Every trip you take in your semi exposes the mirrors to hazards and grime. Don't find out too late that one of your mirrors is filthy and doesn't give you a clear view of traffic.
<h2>Use Mirrors Correctly While Driving</h2>
Experts recommend that you keep a constant check on your mirrors at all times when on the road. Glance at your mirrors every 8 to 10 seconds to stay alert to the traffic overtaking you in the lanes behind and to the sides of your rig. By maintaining a view behind you, you can respond safely and quickly in the event of a problem up ahead.

Always check your mirrors before attempting lane changes. Your mirrors will let you know if you have enough room to move to the next lane. Check mirrors again after you signal your intention to change lanes, as you make the lane change, and after you've completed your lane change. Frequent mirror checks before, during, and after lane changes helps you maintain awareness of the vehicles around you.

"4 Occupational Hazards for Truck Drivers | Arrow Truck Sales","Learn about trucking's occupational hazards, including how you can stay safe and reach the end of your truck-driving career hale, whole, and healthy.",90,3,,,,,,,"Resource Center",,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/arrow-trucks.jpg,arrow-trucks.jpg,"E:\Sites\arrowtruck_com\blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/arrow-trucks.jpg",595,arrow-trucks,,,,,,,,,,,,,594,"<img class=""size-medium wp-image-595 alignright"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/arrow-trucks-300x225.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""225"" />It's no secret that long-haul trucking is a dangerous career. After all, every time you get on the road as a commuter, you see accidents, poor driving decisions, and near misses. Spending even more time on the road hauling goods from one end of the country to the other leaves you with no misconceptions about your career's relative safety.
<!--more-->
However, just because trucking can be a dangerous occupation doesn't mean you shouldn’t pursue a career in trucking. Instead, familiarize yourself with some of trucking's most common occupational hazards so that you can understand the dangers you may face on the road — and, even better, how to avoid them altogether or minimize your risk.

Keep reading for a list of trucking's occupational hazards, complete with information on how you can stay safe and reach the end of your truck-driving career hale, whole, and healthy.
<h2>1. Driving Accidents</h2>
The high rate of car accidents is one reason why, in 2016, truck driving was considered <a href=""https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/cfoi_12162016.htm"">the deadliest occupation in the United States</a>. Truck drivers are on the road constantly, and unlike other drivers, they can't always get off the road when the going gets tough — most truck drivers haul through the night and are expected to persevere through harsh weather conditions to deliver products on time.

You can't control other drivers' actions, but you can take a few key steps to protect yourself while on the road:
<ul>
 	<li>Don't break federal limits on driving time. Even if it jeopardizes your arrival time, always pull over and rest for the night if you've driven many hours in a row. Delivering a product on time isn't worth your life.</li>
 	<li>Know how to drive safely in all weather conditions. Always check the weather before you set off on a drive and prepare accordingly (for instance, bring chains whenever you drive in the winter). Get off the road if driving becomes too dangerous.</li>
 	<li>Many car drivers either don't know how to drive around trucks or intentionally antagonize truck drivers. However, road rage endangers everyone on the road, yourself included. Stay calm even when others around you drive foolishly.</li>
</ul>
You can also take steps to reduce the possibility of injury in the event of an accident. Purchase a semi with airbags, and always buckle your seatbelt. Remember, wearing a seatbelt is not just the law — it's a small action that could save your life.
<h2>2. Equipment-Related Injuries</h2>
As a truck driver, you spend a lot of time both doing truck maintenance and lifting the goods you haul. Lifting truck equipment or goods incorrectly can injure your back and knees or even result in death, especially if you're trapped between the truck and trailer while uncoupling or coupling the two.

To avoid injuries, learn how to lift products correctly and without straining your back. Use cargo-moving equipment to deal with heavy loads. When performing maintenance like replacing a tire, stay aware of your surroundings, have every tool you need on hand, and take the time you need to complete the task — rushing through it can increase your risk of injuries during the task or contribute to a truck accident down the line.
<h2>3. Ergonomic Injuries</h2>
Sitting for hours while driving isn't just uncomfortable. It's also actively bad for your health. Sitting in an uncomfortable seat can permanently injure your back. Keeping your hands on a vibrating steering wheel while going over rough roads may contribute to aching joints. Staring at the road for hours, especially in bright sunlight, causes cumulative eye damage over time.

To minimize ergonomic injuries, make a few key changes around your truck. Invest in an ergonomic seat, keep a pair of UV-blocking sunglasses in the cab, and fix issues like misalignment and shaking steering wheels as soon as possible.
<h2>4. Lifestyle-Related Diseases and Injuries</h2>
Life on the road doesn't give you much time to exercise, eat healthily, or connect with friends and family. Diseases like diabetes and problems like poor digestion or malnutrition are real issues resulting from gas-station food and a lack of exercise.

The stressful job and boredom lead some truckers to smoke, a habit that contributes to diseases like lung cancer, and the lack of connection with other people can cause mental health deterioration that contributes to depression or, in extreme cases, suicide.

To stay healthy while on the job, keep your cab stocked with healthy, non-perishable foods like freeze-dried apples and whole-grain crackers. Make exercise a daily habit, even if that means walking around the rest stop for 10 minutes. Talk to a doctor about changing habits like smoking to extend your lifespan.

Reach out to friends and family even when you're on the road. If you experience anxiety and sadness that refuse to dissipate, get in touch with a therapist once you're safely back at home after a job.

When you're aware of the industry's most common occupational hazards, you can do what's necessary to reduce their impact on your life. Along with taking the actions listed above, make sure your truck is your friend — not your foe — when it comes to staying safe on the road.

"Fatigue-Fighting Tips for Truckers | Arrow Truck Sales","Fatigue can lead to drivers falling asleep at the wheel, and this problem is all too common for long-haul truckers. Use these tips to combat fatigue.",90,3,,,,,,,"Resource Center",,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Truck-drive-fighting-fatigue.jpg,Truck-drive-fighting-fatigue.jpg,"E:\Sites\arrowtruck_com\blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Truck-drive-fighting-fatigue.jpg",605,Truck-drive-fighting-fatigue,,,,,,,,,,,,,604,"<img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-605"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Truck-drive-fighting-fatigue-300x200.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""200"" />Starting a trucking career as an owner/operator is an exciting thing. Something about being behind the wheel of a <a href=""https://www.arrowtruck.com/Docs/search.results.aspx"">big rig</a> and hitting the road for a long-haul route appeals to many people. But in addition to enjoying the prospect of new adventures, consider how you're going to stay safe during the long hours of solo driving.<!--more-->

It's an unfortunate fact that truck driving can be dangerous. In 2016, over 100,000 documented traffic accidents involved large trucks, and around 4,000 of these accidents resulted in a fatality. That's why you must understand the risk factors that can make an accident on the road more likely.

One of the biggest causes of crashes is driver fatigue. Fatigue causes mental impairment and reduced reaction time, which can be fatal on the road. In extreme cases, fatigue can also lead to drivers falling asleep at the wheel, which significantly increases the risk of fatal crashes. Fatigue is all too common for long-haul truckers, but you can help yourself to combat it with these six tips.
<h2>1. Stop for Regular Exercise Breaks</h2>
Sitting in the cab of your truck for long stretches of time can contribute to overall fatigue. Sitting still can drop your body temperature, which your body sees as a sleep trigger. Stopping regularly to revive your body with a little exercise is a great way to stave off fatigue.

A short walk or some simple stretches every so often is enough to shake off fatigue. This burst of exercise will raise your temperature, get your blood pumping a bit faster, and give you a refreshing rush of energy.
<h2>2. Keep Your Cab the Right Temperature</h2>
Another thing that can cause fatigue, drowsiness, and falling asleep at the wheel is keeping your cab at the wrong temperature. Too cold, and your body will trigger the sleep response that helps you fall asleep at bedtime. Too warm, and your body can become sluggish and drowsy.

You need to find the Goldilocks zone — not too hot, not too cold — that will keep you alert. This temperature will vary from person to person, and you may need to spend some time figuring out the best cab temperature for your body. If you feel fatigue creeping in, try dropping or raising the temperature and see if doing so revives you.
<h2>3. Stay Well-Hydrated</h2>
Another common cause of fatigue is dehydration. It can cause your blood pressure to decrease, which doesn't allow enough oxygen-rich blood to reach your brain. Lack of adequate blood flow can cause you to feel sleepy and fatigued.

The best way to stay hydrated is to drink plenty of water and avoid sugary and caffeinated beverages as much as possible. If you suspect that you are dehydrated, a sports drink that contains electrolytes can help your body quickly get back to a healthy level of hydration.
<h2>4. Avoid Eating Too Many Carbs</h2>
Carbohydrates are often a staple of trucker foods. At any truck stop, you'll find a wide variety of carbohydrate-rich foods, such as sandwiches, fries, and pizza. However, these foods can increase fatigue, particularly if you eat too much of them. Carbohydrates convert to glucose once they're digested, but once the glucose is burned up, you'll get a post-carb crash that can make you incredibly tired.

If you do eat carbs, make sure that they are complex carbohydrates such as whole-meal bread. Complex carbs break down more slowly than simple carbs, such as white bread and pizza dough. This delay helps to prevent the overwhelming crash and keeps your energy levels higher for longer.
<h2>5. Pump Up the Music</h2>
If you feel fatigue creep in when you're on the road, pump up some lively and energetic music. Music has been shown to increase energy levels and combat fatigue by activating the sympathetic nervous system. Biologically, doing this makes your body ready for action and sharpens your mental response to the world around you.
<h2>6. Get Enough Sleep</h2>
This may seem like a no-brainer, but it's surprising how many people are going through life without getting enough sleep at night. Sleep-deprivation may not be so noticeable after one or two nights, but over time this sleep deficit can take a real toll on your health and levels of fatigue.

If you've had a poor night's sleep or have put in long hours of night driving, catch up on rest when you have the opportunity. A short nap in your truck's cab can help make up for the lost hours and prevent dangerous fatigue from becoming overwhelming. For this reason, make sure that the rig you buy has a comfortable sleeping area that can be kept dark if you sleep during the day.

"Rig-Top Ice and Snow | Arrow Truck Sales","While spring is on its way in many areas, snow will continue to fall in many locations. Learn what you need to do to clear ice and snow from your semitruck.",60,3,,,,,,,"Resource Center",,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/rig-top-ice-street.jpg,rig-top-ice-street.jpg,"E:\Sites\arrowtruck_com\blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/rig-top-ice-street.jpg",613,rig-top-ice-street,,,,,,,,,,,,,611,"<img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-613"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/rig-top-ice-street-300x201.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""201"" />While spring is on its way in many areas of the U.S., snow will continue to fall in many locations. If you're a trucker who routinely drives in snowy, frozen conditions, your truck and trailer can pose a hazard to other drivers (and you) if snow and ice build up on top of your rig. Here's what you should know about keeping your semi and trailer clear of ice and snow.<!--more-->
<h2>Recent Incidents Prove the Hazards</h2>
In February of 2019, a six-year-old child was injured by ice that fell from a tractor-trailer on Interstate 495 in Massachusetts. A large sheet of ice smashed through the windshield of the car in which the child was a passenger.

Truckers can be victims of uncleared vehicle ice, too. In January 2019 on the New York State Thruway, a huge sheet of ice sailed off the top of a mini-van and shattered the windshield of a semitruck. The driver was temporarily unable to see, as his truck's entire windshield was covered in broken ice.

Reports of roadway problems from uncleared snow and ice have been made across the U.S. this winter. Each incident highlights the safety concerns for everyone on the road when drivers fail to clear snow and ice from the tops of their vehicles.
<h2>Some States Demand Ice and Snow Clearing</h2>
When ice and snow slide off of moving vehicles, the results can be deadly. In 1999, <a href=""https://cdllife.com/2019/troopers-force-truckers-climb-top-trailers-snow-removal-enforcement-blitz/"">Jessica Smith</a> was killed after a nine-foot section of ice slid from the top of a tractor-trailer rig, bounced off of a box truck, and slammed into Jessica's vehicle.

The State of New Hampshire, recognizing the profound roadway hazards created when people don't clear ice from their vehicles, approved a law known as Jessica's Law in 2002. Drivers who don't remove packed ice and snow from their vehicles can be cited and fined in the state of New Hampshire.

Fines in New Hampshire range from $250 to $500 for a driver's first offense and up to $1,000 for subsequent failures to clear ice and snow from vehicles. Drivers who are cited more than once for failure to clean their vehicles can eventually lose their licenses in New Hampshire.

Recently, the New Hampshire State Police set up a semi-rig snow-removal detail on an interstate highway to boost efforts to enforce Jessica's Law. Truckers with snow and ice on their vehicles were pulled over and forced to climb on top of their trailers to clear them before being allowed to continue driving.
<h2>Several States Have Snow and Ice Clearing Laws</h2>
Similar laws are in place in several states where winter snow and ice are common occurrences. Penalties and fines vary among the states that enforce such laws.

You can be cited for failure to de-ice your truck in New Hampshire and the <strong><a href=""https://tandemthoughts.landlinemag.com/commentary/winter-driving-foes-raise-familiar-ugly-heads/"">following states</a></strong>:
<ul>
 	<li>Alabama</li>
 	<li>Connecticut</li>
 	<li>Georgia</li>
 	<li>Iowa</li>
 	<li>Michigan</li>
 	<li>New Jersey</li>
 	<li>Pennsylvania</li>
 	<li>Rhode Island</li>
 	<li>Wisconsin</li>
</ul>
Although only the above states have specific statutes in place for snow and ice removal, you aren't off the hook in states without such laws if your rig dumps ice on another driver. Truckers can be cited for ice and snow slides using other state laws.

For example, in the above case where a six-year-old was injured by ice in Massachusetts, the state found the driver guilty of transporting an unsecured load. States can use laws including unsecured-load laws to fine and punish truckers who fail to clean their rigs, even if no specific laws are on their books to address ice and snow.
<h2>Truckers Must Clear Ice and Snow With Caution</h2>
The trucking industry is in a precarious position when it comes to clearing ice and snow from tractor-trailer rigs. While the snow and ice pose danger to other drivers, standing on top of an icy rig is also dangerous.

In some cases, asking truckers to climb up on frozen rigs and rake off snow without any personal protection equipment (PPE) is a clear violation of Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) rules. So what is a trucker to do?

First, if at all possible, truckers should park their rigs in covered locations during heavy snow storms. Tarps and other covers can be secured to some trailers to reduce snow and ice buildup.

Truckers should inspect their rigs before each trip to check for snow and ice sheets on their tractor-trailers. If there is snow, determine the best way to remove it without putting yourself at risk. If you climb on top of your rig, use fall protection and have a spotter to help you if you run into trouble.

When you drive often in icy, snowy areas, locate companies and facilities that perform semi snow clearing near your routes. Various machines and attachments designed for truck and trailer snow and ice removal are available at truck stops and service centers throughout colder regions.

You’ll need to pay a charge for this service in most cases. However, the cost is minimal when you consider the expense of possible fines, extra vehicle weight, and increased fuel consumption you must endure when ice and snow build up atop your rig.

"Updated CVSA Out-of-Service Criteria | Arrow Truck Sales","Effective April 1, 2019, all truck drivers must comply with updated CVSA out-of-service rules. Learn more about the updated criteria.",30,,,,,,,,"Resource Center",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,617,"<img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-613"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/truck-on-road.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""201"" />
Effective April 1, 2019, drivers must comply with updated Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance (CVSA) out-of-service rules. Here are five facts about the North American Standard Out-of-Service Criteria that all drivers should understand.

<!--more-->

 	<h2>Drivers and Fleet Managers Can Purchase Handbooks</h2>

CVSA updates its out-of-service rules every year. In autumn, Class 1 voting members discuss and approve of proposed changes to the out-of-service criteria. In April of the following year, any adopted changes are officially put into effect.

Out-of-service violations are serious business. If an inspection finds that you or your rig are in violation of CVSA's official Out-of-Service Criteria, you, your rig, and your carrier can be placed out of service until the violations are remedied.

All annual updates are published in the <em>North American Standard Out-of-Service Criteria Handbook and Pictorial</em>. Both print and PDF versions of the handbook are available for use both with paper training materials and handheld devices.

CVSA makes the handbooks available for a fee to fleet managers, drivers, and others who need to know the rules about out-of-service violations. Updated bulletins, training videos, and inspection materials are also available from the CVSA National Training Center.

 	<h2>Drivers Should Pick Their Seats Carefully</h2>

You may be a seasoned driving professional who can handle a big rig while you're perched precariously on a fruit crate. The CVSA begs to differ with you.

Effective April 1, 2019, you won't pass inspection and will be placed in an out-of-service condition if your semi or other large rig doesn't have a proper driver's seat. Don't think that you can fool inspectors if you simply place an unsecured seat in the cab.

All drivers' seats have to be secured to the vehicles that are being operated. Drivers' seats can't be loosely attached in the cabs but must be fastened to their rigs in workmanlike fashion.

Changes to out-of-service criteria for driver's seating is an addition to Part II. The change is now Item 5 on the criteria list. Be proactive about the new seating rule and check your driver's seat any time you drive a new rig. Routinely tighten bolts and other fasteners on your normal semi's seating.

 	<h2> Drivers Need to Keep Rig Mechanics in Shape</h2>

Inspectors can now call you out-of-service for bad brakes, drive shafts, and steering systems. Amendments to Part II that cover these out-of-service criteria include Items 3, 6, 8, and 10.

Inspectors can now place your rig out of service if they find cracks in structural supports of brake rotors. Cracked vents in brake rotors are signs that the rotors are due to collapse soon. You'll need to replace the rotors and have them inspected to get back on the road.

New drive-train and drive-shaft rules cover bearing straps, which weren't addressed prior to the new changes. A missing or broken bearing strap is now a violation of CVSA out-of-service criteria.

Don't get caught with non-manufactured holes in your steering system drag link. Non-manufactured drag-link holes are a failing criteria for pass-fail inspections under the new guidelines.

 	<h2>Drivers Need to Keep Up Their Health and Skills</h2>

Skill Performance Evaluations (SPEs) are special certificates that must be carried at all times by impaired CMV drivers when they cross state lines. Operators of semis who have missing or impaired limbs including fingers, arms, feet, or legs can obtain SPE certificates. SPE certificates clear the impaired individuals to drive professionally from state to state.

Under Amendment Item 4 of Part I of the CVSA rules, drivers can be placed out of service even if they possess valid SPE documents. If a driver can't currently comply with SPE requirements, the driver can be placed out of service with or without SPE proof in hand.

For example, an SPE may stipulate that a hearing-impaired driver may operate a rig as long as the driver uses specialty hearing equipment. If the hearing-impaired driver is found operating their rig without their approved hearing equipment in use, the driver can be placed out of service.

 	<h2> Drivers Should Remove Expired CVSA Decals</h2>

Before you place that new CVSA decal on your truck, spend some time removing the old decal. As part of its 2019 updated criteria, CVSA states that removing your old CVSA decal is most appropriate.

Having only one CVSA decal on your truck at all times makes it easier for inspectors and other officials to find the current, valid sticker. Your truck will also look cleaner when you spend time removing outdated and worn decals.

Earn your valid new CVSA sticker honestly by going over the out-of-service criteria and repairing any defects in your rig. Spend some time learning about CVSA criteria for cargo tie-downs, exhaust systems, and other violations that could cost you valuable time on the highway. Ask your motor carrier or fleet manager for copies of the current CVSA handbook if you drive for someone else.

"Summer Driving Tips to Avoid Heat-Related Illness | Arrow Truck Sales","If you have long hauls to make this summer, you need to protect yourself against illnesses like heat exhaustion and heatstroke. Read this blog for tips.",30,3,,,,,,,"Resource Center",,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/summer-driving.jpg,summer-driving.jpg,"E:\Sites\arrowtruck_com\blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/summer-driving.jpg",626,summer-driving,,,,,,,,,,,,,624,"<img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-626"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/summer-driving-300x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""300"" />Drivers can't afford to be laid up at home with health problems in the summer months with so much freight out there to haul. However, it's easier than you think to succumb to heat exhaustion or heatstroke while driving a rig in summer. Here are some smart trucking tips to keep you cool in the hottest driving conditions.<!--more-->
<h2>Start Drinking Before Summer Trips</h2>
Did you know that it's easier for your body to stay hydrated in dry conditions if you start boosting your water intake in advance? When you know you'll be hitting the road for New Mexico, Arizona, or any other hot, arid region this summer, increase your water intake as soon as you can.

You may have to use the restroom more often when you add more fluids to your diet. The extra hassle is worth it to protect your body from heat-related problems.

Continue hydrating yourself throughout your trips in hot locations to maintain alertness and aid your body in fighting off the effects of high heat conditions. Keep your water bottle or other drinks close at hand in the cab, so you can take a drink whenever you like.
<h2>Know the Right Stuff to Drink</h2>
Choose water to quench your thirst whenever possible. Clean, plain water is refreshing and has no sugars or carbs to interfere with your metabolism.

Other healthy and hydrating drink and snack choices include the following:
<ol style= "" margin: 0em 0em 2em 3em;"">
 	<li>Plain milk</li>
 	<li>Fruit-infused water</li>
 	<li>Unsweetened fruit juice</li>
 	<li>Watermelon</li>
 	<li>Sports beverage</li>
 	<li>Unsweetened tea</li>
 	<li>Coconut water</li>
 	<li>Soy, coconut, or almond milk</li>
</ol><br>
Soft drinks are some of the worst beverage choices to hydrate your body, even though an ice-cold cola feels refreshing as you swallow the frosty fluid from the can or bottle. The caffeine, sodium, and sugar in many soft drinks make you thirstier because these ingredients actually dehydrate your system.

Alcohol is another no-no in high-heat situations, even when you're off the clock. When you drink a beer or shot of liquor, the alcohol removes fluid from your cells rather than replacing lost fluids. Sweet tea, high-sugar energy drinks, flavored milk, and smoothies are also poor choices when you need to hydrate your body for the long haul.
<h2>Keep Your Truck's AC in Good Working Order</h2>
Heat-related illnesses (and deaths) are preventable when good air conditioning (AC) is available. AC is the top protector of people who are at risk of heat-related problems.

If your semi truck's AC system isn't working or doesn't work properly at idle, consult with your mechanic or fleet maintenance staff to fix the AC problem. When your delivery routes take you through hot regions of the country, purchase all future trucks with proper AC systems for both the cab and sleeper sections.

If you get stuck in a hot zone with no air conditioning, make frequent stops to lower your body temperature in air-conditioned places. Rest areas, malls, and truck stops are usually cool indoor places with truck parking and ample seating. Give yourself time to cool off completely before moving along, so you don't put yourself at risk of getting dizzy or disoriented from the heat while driving.
<h2>Know the Signs of Serious Heat-Related Illness</h2>
Heat can cause serious illness and even death in otherwise healthy persons. If you must load and unload freight or do other heavy work in hot conditions, you could succumb to a heat-related illness before you realize how sick you are. Two risky heat-related conditions are heat exhaustion and heatstroke.

Heat exhaustion is a serious medical problem that may or may not require medical attention. Signs of heat exhaustion include the following symptoms:
<ol style= "" margin: 0em 0em 2em 3em;"">
 	<li>Sweating profusely</li>
 	<li>Skin that's cold and clammy</li>
 	<li>Pulse that's faint and rapid</li>
 	<li>Cramps in stomach and/or muscles</li>
 	<li>Exhaustion</li>
 	<li>Dizziness and headache</li>
 	<li>Fainting</li>
 	<li>Sick to the stomach</li>
</ol><br>
If you or another worker is showing the above signs of heat exhaustion, move the affected person to a cool spot, loosen their garments, and apply cold compresses. The person should take small sips of water and seek professional medical care if they're vomiting or if symptoms continue past an hour.

Heatstroke is a <em>medical emergency</em> and always requires immediate medical care. Signs of heatstroke include the following:
<ol style= "" margin: 0em 0em 2em 3em;"">
 	<li>Body temperature above 103 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
 	<li>Skin that's hot to the touch</li>
 	<li>Skin that's red; skin that's dry or damp</li>
 	<li>Dizziness and nausea</li>
 	<li>Disorientation</li>
 	<li>Loss of consciousness</li>
</ol><br>
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, you should move a person suffering from heatstroke to a cool location while another person (or you if you're alone) contacts 911. Use cold, wet cloths to help lower the heat-affected person's body temperature or assist the heat-affected person with a cool bath until first responders are on the scene. Never give a person with heatstroke a sip of water.

"4 Benefits of Vigilant Truck Tire Maintenance | Arrow Truck Sales","Truck tire maintenance can help drivers be safe, efficient and more compliant. Read on to learn four ways in which tire maintenance can help.",30,3,,,,,,,"Resource Center",,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/tire-maintenance.jpg,tire-maintenance.jpg,"E:\Sites\arrowtruck_com\blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/tire-maintenance.jpg",637,tire-maintenance,,,,,,,,,,,,,634,"<img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-637"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/tire-maintenance-300x200.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""200"" />Tire blowouts increase in summer, so the hottest season is a great time to review your truck’s or your entire fleet's tire maintenance program. When you and your drivers are vigilant about semi-truck tire inspections and care, your drivers receive these four benefits.<!--more-->
<ol>
 	<li>
<h2>Better Road Performance</h2>
</li>
</ol>
A proper truck tire maintenance schedule includes routinely checking all of the tires on every truck for surface wear, tire pressure, tread depth, and grime. Alignment and rotation of tires is also part of a comprehensive tire-maintenance plan.

When semi-truck tires are in good shape and have adequate tread for the driving conditions, the tires perform better on the road. The overall ride is smoother for the trucker and the truck components. Braking and turning are easier and safer for the driver in a rig with good tires.

Properly aligned and rotated tires perform better because the tires wear more evenly. Misaligned tires will develop worn spots that make tires vibrate or veer to one side when drivers steer around curves or apply the brakes. If tires are never rotated, uneven wear can cause tires to prematurely fail.

Develop a strict inspection and maintenance schedule for all of your truck tires to get the optimum performance from your tire investments. Keep track of alignment and rotation schedules, so every truck and tire gets the attention it deserves.
<ol start=""2"">
 	<li>
<h2>Increased Fuel Efficiency</h2>
</li>
</ol>
Inflate semi tires to the proper levels for the best fuel performance. Underinflated tires reduce fuel economy and lower the lifespan of truck tires.

The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that a vehicle running on underinflated tires has reduced gas mileage by up to 0.3 percent for each pound-per-square-inch of too-low tire-inflation pressure. Trucking fleets and individual truckers often run their companies on tight budgets, so proper tire inflation can make a significant impact on the fuel expenses of the modest owner-operator or fleet operator.

Why do tires use more fuel when the tires are underinflated? Underinflated tires make more contact with the road, since the tires' footprint is elongated when not fully inflated. When more rubber makes contact with the road, the tire becomes excessively hot. The rolling resistance of the underinflated tire increases, causing more friction between the tire and the road as well as increased fuel consumption.

Insist that drivers or your maintenance crew routinely check the tire pressure on all semi-trucks in service. Tire pressure should be checked at least once per week, so any problems with improper inflation can be caught and corrected before tire problems develop.
<ol start=""3"">
 	<li>
<h2>Less Driver Downtime</h2>
</li>
</ol>
Heat causes air molecules to expand, so tires can sometimes become overinflated in summer. If truck tires are driven in an underinflated state during the winter (whether intentionally done to increase truck-tire traction or unintentionally occurring due to cold-weather contraction), cracks and other problems develop on the sidewalls and other components of the underinflated tires.

Underinflated tires flex more under load, which puts excess pressure on all parts of the tires' construction. When previously underinflated tires are properly inflated in the summer, the tires are prone to fail due to the cracks and other weaknesses that developed in the tires while in their underinflated state.

Tires that have been routinely run at 20 percent or more under their recommended inflation pressures are more likely to suffer from zipper rupture. Zipper rupture occurs when the sidewall of a chronically underinflated tire experiences fatigue. The tire becomes so degraded in spots, proper inflation causes the tire to blow.

The worst possible time for a tire blowout is when a trucker is on the road. One bad tire can cause delayed delivery, increased driver fatigue, and scheduling disruptions.

When truck tire pressures and tire conditions are routinely checked, drivers experience less downtime on the road waiting for tire replacements or repair. A few moments each week checking semi-truck tires for proper inflation can save your drivers from wasting hours of their precious time.
<ol start=""4"">
 	<li>
<h2>Enhanced Fleet Safety</h2>
</li>
</ol>
A safe trucking fleet is a productive trucking fleet. Trucking companies and owner-operators who practice vigilant tire care experience fewer tire-related emergencies and collisions. Semi-truck drivers and other motorists are safer on the road when truck tires are in the best shape possible for the loads the tires must carry.

A comprehensive truck tire maintenance plan can keep your vehicle and workers compensation insurance premiums from increasing. You'll make fewer claims for tire-related accidents and collisions when your team catches tire problems before blowouts or other tire-safety issues happen.

When a trucking firm has a reputation for safety, the trucking company attracts clients who want the top people to deliver their goods. Your responsible trucking company attracts drivers who want to work under safe conditions and in safe vehicles. You get to hire some of the best drivers in the business when they learn that your team follows a strict tire safety program.

"Hauling Livestock Tips | Arrow Truck Sales","Do you want to haul livestock as a business? Learn three things that every truck should know about hauling livestock before you commit to the business.",60,3,,,,,,,"Resource Center",,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/livestock.jpg,livestock.jpg,"E:\Sites\arrowtruck_com\blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/livestock.jpg",642,livestock,,,,,,,,,,,,,641,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-642"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/livestock-300x200.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""200"" />Do you want to haul livestock as a business? The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration states that around </span><a href=""https://www.truckdrivingjobs.com/blog/895/livestock-transportation-basics.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">250,000 drivers</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> are specialty livestock haulers in the U.S. alone. Obviously, you'll be in good company if you choose to transport living freight. Here are three things every trucker should understand about hauling livestock.</span><!--more-->
<h2><b>1. Livestock Hauling Pay Is Higher for Good Reasons</b></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Specialty haulers including livestock transporters are paid a higher rate for picking up and delivering animals including cattle, swine, poultry, and horses. The pay for hauling live freight is increased for several important reasons.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">First, livestock haulers must maintain valid certifications including a Class A commercial driving permit. Drivers must also obtain certification for specific animals they transport. For example, a trucker may need to secure special endorsements or certificates to haul sheep or hogs. The livestock haulers must show they understand the details and perils of moving specific species of live freight.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Second, you need a specialty trailer to haul livestock. The type of trailer you purchase will depend on the types of animals you're hauling and how far your livestock deliveries will take you.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you plan to haul cattle or poultry, you can purchase a plain, well-made, ventilated cattle car or cage trailer, which will be suitable for most of your customers. If you go to haul high-dollar show horses, you need a fancier enclosed rig with extra safety features for the animals.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">All livestock-hauling trailers must have leak-proof floors. Your trailer must also be easy to wash down and disinfect. Rubber mats on the trailer floor are a plus when hauling animals who must stand throughout the trip, but they are extras that add expenses to your livestock-hauling rig.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Third, hauling living things holds more potential for personal harm to the trucker than hauling dead weight. Animals can bite, kick, escape, or get stuck in the trailer. A poorly loaded livestock trailer can easily tip over and cause injury or death to the driver or the animals inside.</span>
<h2><b>2. Biosecurity Is a Trucker's Responsibility</b></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Farmers and officials are increasingly vigilant about clean, biosecure handling practices when working with or around livestock intended for food. Many animal diseases are easily spread from farm to farm by vectors as seemingly harmless as the bottom of your shoes or your semitruck's tires.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If your livestock trailer is not routinely cleaned and disinfected after each load of living freight, subsequent loads of animals can become infected by the following:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Feces, blood, and urine</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Feed and water containers</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Insects and parasites</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Live bacteria or viruses on surfaces</span></li>
</ul>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As vital members of the livestock supply chain, livestock haulers must be aware of transmission risks from delivery site to delivery site. Livestock haulers must practice biosecure protocols whenever they pick up, deliver, and transport livestock.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many poultry farms install warning signs to alert visitors and workers to the steps they must take to ensure biosecurity. If no signs are present, a good practice for truckers is to ask each customer about their biosecure protocols.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Biosecure transporter behavior around a poultry operation may include the following:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Shower and wear clean clothes to every site.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Use gloves on hands when touching animals or surfaces.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Use masks and coveralls in dusty conditions.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Properly dispose of used masks, gloves, and coveralls.</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Wash hands well before and after handling poultry.</span></li>
</ul>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you own pet birds or chickens, you could unwittingly transmit diseases from your fowl to farm poultry. Avoid spreading diseases by disinfecting your shoes before getting out of the truck, or wear shoe coverings while you're working with customers' livestock.</span>
<h2><b>3. New Legislation Could Help Livestock Haulers</b></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Livestock haulers throughout the country were dismayed when the mandatory electronic logging device (ELD) legislation took effect in December of 2017. The ELD rules are intended to track drivers' adherence to hours-of-service (HOS) regulations, but the rules don't take into account the special conditions under which livestock haulers work.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Rigid HOS rules can cause harm to loaded livestock, since the laws require drivers to take extended stops when they've reached or exceeded their allowable driving hours. Livestock left to sit and wait in frigid or high-heat conditions can become sick or even die while the driver fulfills the terms of ELD regulations.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Requirements of ELD rules have been suspended until September of 2019 for livestock haulers, but remain worrying to drivers. The Transporting Livestock Across America Safely (TLAAS) Act has been introduced by U.S. senators to address the problems with ELD rules and livestock safety. Some of the changes include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">No calculation of HOD or ELD until 300 air-miles are driven</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Extension of HOD on-time duty maximums</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Exemption of livestock loading and unloading from HOS calculations</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Allowing drivers flexibility to rest without counting against HOS</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Allowing drivers to finish delivery if they arrive within 150 air-miles of destination</span></li>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Regardless of your experience driving your truck cross-country, you might not be able to maneuver your vehicle through a natural disaster or severe storm. And breakdowns can pose their own slew of problems when you're trying to make a deadline on your delivery. Fortunately, you don't have to embark on your next route unprepared.</span><!--more-->

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Before you put the pedal to the metal, read our emergency preparedness guide below. Here, we discuss which items you should keep stocked in your truck in case you experience or encounter any kind of emergency on the road.</span>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Emergencies to Plan For</span></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">First, you should know exactly what kinds of emergencies you should plan for during each specific journey. Generally, though, you should prepare for the following scenarios</span>
<ul>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Severe weather like heavy rain or snowstorms</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Flooding</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Traffic jams</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Truck breakdowns</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Wildfires</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Landslides</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Rockslides</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Tornadoes</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Road closures</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Accidents</span></li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">High winds</span></li>
</ul>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Many hazards will vary based on your location and the time of year. Before you hit the road, you can also check the National Weather Service or use an app to track specific weather conditions along your route.</span>
<h2><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Items to Stock</span></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Regardless of which emergency situation you're preparing for, you can stock several basic items in your truck to keep you covered.</span>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Tools</span></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Whether your truck breaks down on the side of the road or you simply need to tweak a few things on your rig, a basic toolkit can make all the difference in an emergency situation. Keep a hammer, various styles of screwdrivers (including a Phillips and flathead), wrenches, and pliers in your truck so you can do any necessary maintenance to get your vehicle to the nearest pit stop.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you routinely perform mechanical work on your truck, you could amp up your tool kit with with more specific repair tools. This equipment can allow you to work more intensely on your vehicle (if circumstances allow) so you aren't without transportation for long.</span>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Clothing</span></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The clothing you keep in your emergency kit will depend entirely on the season and your routes. For example, if you travel during the winter season, stock your truck with a few pairs of wool socks, thick pants and shirts, warm hats, and gloves. But if your final destination is in a warmer climate, you should also include lighter clothing so you don't overheat.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">An extra pair of shoes can prove useful as well. Boots, for example, can keep your feet dry and warm in a snowstorm. And an extra pair of sneakers or work boots can protect your feet should your current pair become unwearable.</span>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Food</span></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Every emergency kit should include food and beverages to keep you fueled and hydrated for two to five days. Stock up on non-perishable food you can eat without heating. For example, protein-based snacks (like peanut butter or protein bars) can sustain you if you get stuck in a traffic jam or on the side of the road for hours. Ramen noodles also make for a great crunchy treat and can last for a while in your emergency kit.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You should also store water, juices, and sports drinks in your truck to prevent dehydration and restore electrolytes.</span>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Medication</span></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Add a few small bottles of pain relievers, allergy pills, antacids, and other medications you use regularly to your kit. Likewise, if you use prescription medications to treat any health conditions, try to keep some in your kit to keep your health in good standing.</span>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Miscellaneous Items</span></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Include a flashlight, hand-crank radio, calling card, solar charger, blankets, duct tape, a tarp, a whistle, and a blade (like a knife or small hatchet) in your kit so you can call for help, build a makeshift tent, or otherwise care for yourself during a disaster. You can store these items in a five-gallon bucket that doubles as a portable toilet.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you have room in your truck, also include a sleeping bag, a small set of dishes, a can opener, a first aid kit, towels, and washcloths. You could also pack a small bag of personal hygiene supplies to keep yourself clean and fresh during minor emergencies.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Use this guide to create your own emergency preparedness kit before your next long haul so that you’re prepared for unexpected scenarios or delays. You can also make your kit more specific to your preferences and needs. Don't forget to rotate your items regularly. The last thing you need during an emergency is to have broken or inoperable tools and expired food, water, and medication in your kit.</span>

If you're a trucker, discover some go-to foods that are good to eat at truck stops.",90,3,,,,,,652,"Resource Center",,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pretzles.jpg,pretzles.jpg,"E:\Sites\arrowtruck_com\blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pretzles.jpg",653,pretzles,,,,,,,,,,,,,652,"<span style=""font-weight: 400;""><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-653"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pretzles-300x200.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""200"" />Truck stops are convenient places to get food, with lots of options available. Not everything at a truck stop is healthy or entirely helpful when you need to stay awake while driving, though. If you're a trucker, here are some go-to foods that are good to eat at truck stops.</span><!--more-->
<h2><b>Vegetables and Fruits</b></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vegetables and fruits are nature's convenient snacks, and they're some of the best foods you can find at truck stops. You should aim for </span><a href=""https://www.cbsnews.com/news/for-a-longer-life-researchers-say-eat-this-many-fruits-and-veggies-per-day/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">five to nine servings</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> of vegetables and fruits per day, so you'll have a hard time eating too many of these. Bananas, oranges, and apples are especially convenient options, but many places also have grapes, carrots, and other produce.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">As you choose vegetables and fruits, make sure to avoid options that have sweet dips. Sugary dips not only add calories but also can lead to a crash later that may make staying awake difficult. Savory dips, such as hummus and baba ganoush, are fine because they're more filling and don't contain a lot of sugar.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you don't like the texture of vegetables and fruits, you can use juice as an alternative. A juice made solely from vegetables and fruits will have all of the nutrients that the fresh produce offers, and you don't need to worry about an unwanted texture.</span>
<h2><b>Nuts</b></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Several reasons exist for why nuts are a great food for truckers.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">First, nuts are storable in a truck for some time and they won't go bad. They don't have to be refrigerated, and they won't degrade if left in the sun. As long as they're in a sealed container, they'll remain fresh and tasty. The worst that will likely happen is they'll get a little stale if the container is left open.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Second, nuts are a natural and filling source of protein. When you can't stop to cook a burger and don't want to keep a turkey sandwich that needs to remain cold in your truck, any kind of nut is a good alternate protein.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Third, nuts also work as an effective substitute for potato chips. If you're addicted to the crunch of chips, nuts are another crunchy food that you can snack on. Although nuts still have fats, many — including pistachios, almonds, and walnuts — are full of unsaturated fats that help lower LDL, or bad cholesterol.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">To make sure your nut snack is as healthy as possible, avoid seasoned or salty nut mixes. Seasonings often add calories, and salt will make you thirsty — which could tempt you to reach for a calorie-laden beverage.</span>
<h2><b>Seeds</b></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Seeds have many of the same benefits as nuts. They store well, are high in protein, and help lower cholesterol. They also are full of fiber, which can help the digestive system.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You have lots of good seeds to choose from. Sunflower seeds are popular, and pulling the seeds out of their shell can help pass time. Pumpkin seeds, flax seeds, and chia seeds are also all good options.</span>
<h2><b>Pretzels</b></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you have to eat something that's salty and crunchy, pretzels are a good food. They don't have much nutritional value — they're essentially toasted bread with salt — but they are usually a lot healthier than potato chips and other salty snack foods. Most pretzels have minimal, if any, fat.</span>
<h2><b>Oatmeal</b></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For breakfast, oatmeal is an excellent food. It can help lower cholesterol, lower blood pressure, and reduce the risk of heart disease. It also is nutrient-rich and filling, and you can make it quickly if you have hot water.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Oatmeal on its own is bland, but you can easily add spices and fruit to boost its flavor. Just avoid any sugary pre-made toppings, as adding those will counteract the health benefits that oatmeal offers.</span>
<h2><b>Parfaits</b></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Parfaits are also wonderful for breakfast or a midday snack. Parfaits combine yogurt, granola, and dairy, and, thereby, cover three food groups. They're also tasty because the fruit provides flavor and the granola creates crunch. Moreover, you don’t need too long to eat a parfait if you're in a hurry.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Be aware that not all parfaits are equally healthy, though. Those with unflavored yogurt are usually best, as flavored yogurt tends to be laden with sugar.</span>
<h2><b>Hummus</b></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Hummus is a handy food. It's filling, healthy, and can be unrefrigerated for a little while since it has no meat or dairy in it. It consists of chickpeas, oil, and spices. These provide nutrients, protein, and fiber. Many varieties are also nut-free, making it a possible choice if you're allergic to dairy or nuts.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Moreover, hummus can be eaten any number of ways. Dip pretzels or vegetables in it, or spread it on a sandwich. You can even eat it plain if you really want to. It's tasty enough to have alone.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you're a trucker and ever need a </span><a href=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/""><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">semi-truck</span></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">, contact Arrow Truck Sales.</span>",,"2019-10-28 20:42:25",post,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/2019/10/28/what-to-eat-at-a-truck-stop/,publish,1,ATSBlogM,schaiyote@arrowtruck.com,,,what-to-eat-at-a-truck-stop,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2019-10-28 20:43:37"
"Expenses and Money Saving Tips | Arrow Truck Sales","Truck owner-operators have the benefit of control over their profits. Read this blog to learn more about expenses and how to save money.",90,,,,,,,,"Resource Center",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,656,"<img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-653"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/truck-on-bridge.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""200"" /><p>Are you a truck driver who is thinking about becoming an owner-operator? If so, you're in good company. According to the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, there are 350,000 owner-operators in the United States. In 2013, those owner-operators drove about 110,000 miles.</p><!--more-->
<p>There are many benefits to becoming an owner operator. Besides owning their own truck, owner-operators also make their own profit and control their own schedule. One downside of being an owner operator is that they must also pay their own expenses. To increase profits, they must reduce these expenses as much as possible.</p>
<p>Here are three major expenses and money-saving tips for owner operators.</p>
<h2>1. Cost of the Truck</h2>
<p>One of the best ways for an owner-operator to save money is for them to buy a used truck rather than new one. A brand new semi-truck easily costs between $100,000 and $150,000. If you want several custom features, the price tag for a brand new truck can reach up to $200,000.</p>
<p>A used semi-truck costs anywhere from <a href=""https://www.costowl.com/automotive/auto-semi-truck-used-cost.html"">$15,000 to $100,000</a>. A used medium-duty truck ranges in price from $20,000 to $40,000. Used heavy-duty semi-trucks cost between $30,000 and $80,000. These prices vary and are dependent upon a number of factors including:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
  <li>Age</li>
  <li>Condition</li>
  <li>Mileage</li>
  <li>Features</li>
</ul>
<p>Buying your truck used is a great way to save money, but you want to make sure you still get a good truck. You don't want to buy something that you will have to spend a lot of money on for repairs. For this reason, when buying a used truck, make sure it is in good condition. You will also want to buy a used truck that has low mileage.</p>
<p>Be sure to take the truck for a test drive. You will most likely have to take out a loan for your truck. When you take out the loan, shop around for the best interest rate.</p>
<h2>2. Fuel Costs</h2>
<p>Fuel is expensive, especially for owner-operators who drive thousands of miles each year. For drivers who expect to drive 100,000 miles a year, they could easily spend nearly $70,000 for diesel fuel. Thankfully, there are some effective ways for owner operators to cut down on fuel costs.</p>
<h3>Drive More Slowly</h3>
<p>As an owner-operator, you'll be tempted to get to your destination as quickly as possible. However, simply by slowing down, you can save money on fuel. If you cut your speed from 75 mph to 65 mph, you'll improve your fuel consumption by <a href=""http://www.rigbooks.com/resources/cutting-fuel-costs-improving-fuel-efficiency-owner-operators"">up to 27%.</a></p>
<p>Besides saving money on fuel by driving more slowly, you'll also reduce your chances of getting pulled over for speeding. This means you'll spend less on tickets as well.</p>
<h3>Cut Idling Times</h3>
<p>You probably know that an idling engine consumes fuel, but do you know how much fuel it consumes? Just one hour of idling can burn up to 1.5 gallons of fuel. If fuel costs $2.50 a gallon, and your truck is idling for 8 hours, you're paying more than $20 just to let your engine idle. If you do this five times a week, that's over $100.</p>
<p>Many drivers let their engine idle when the weather outside is cold so that they can sleep in their trucks and stay warm. If you need to idle your engine in cases like this, an auxiliary power unit can help you save fuel and money.</p>
<h2>3. Maintenance and Repairs</h2>
<p>If you want to be successful as an owner-operator, you'll need to take good care of your truck. This means properly maintaining it and making repairs when necessary. Unfortunately, maintenance and repairs cost a lot of money. According to Truckers Report, most truckers can expect to pay about $15,000 a year to maintain their trucks and make various repairs.</p>
<p>When a semi-truck is in need of repair, the repair is usually due to one of these issues:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
  <li>Brake wear or damage</li>
  <li>Electrical malfunctions</li>
  <li>Tire wear or damage</li>
  <li>Engine troubles</li>
  <li>Air line and hose problems</li>
</ul>
<p>Having to make repairs often means that you won't be able to use your truck for a period of time. The best way to avoid truck repairs is to properly maintain it. This means changing the oil on a regular basis, inspecting your radiator, checking your fuel vent, inspecting your brakes, and greasing your moving parts.</p>
<p>While maintaining your truck costs money, it can help save money, too. The better you maintain your truck, the less repairs you'll be making in the future.</p>

"OTR Vs. Regional Trucking | Arrow Truck Sales","Are you a new owner/operator? OTR and regional trucking are some of the most common types of work available. Discover what you need to know about them.",90,3,,,,,,,"Resource Center",,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/diesel-truck.png,diesel-truck.png,"E:\Sites\arrowtruck_com\blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/diesel-truck.png",667,diesel-truck,,,,,,,,,,,,,665,"<img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-667"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/diesel-truck-300x198.png"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""198"" />You may want to be an owner/operator who takes on any job, but not all trucks are suitable for all types of trucking. OTR and regional trucking are some of the most common types of work available. Discover what you need to know about them.<!--more-->
<h2>What Is OTR Trucking?</h2>
OTR stands for over-the-road, but many people recognize it as long-haul trucking. You will travel long distances and typically stay on the road for a week or more. Some assignments can have you on the road for months at a time.

OTR trucking will take you over state lines and possibly into states or jurisdictions where the trucking rules aren't the same as the state or jurisdiction you previously passed through. You'll have to stay alert and knowledgeable of the rules and laws that govern trucking wherever you go.
<h3><em>Advantages of OTR Trucking</em></h3>
To a certain extent, many companies who hire owner/operators will want to know your long-haul miles more than any other type of trucking you've accomplished. This doesn't mean you can't find work doing other types of driving, but you should first build up OTR miles to start with.

Employers who hire OTR truckers tend to pay more and offer more benefits. As you gain experience, you can also demand more for your services.

Another benefit of OTR trucking comes from the pure joy of traveling. You may be on the job, but you also see new places and travel to areas you may have never seen otherwise. In this way, you can think of OTR trucking as a way to get paid while sightseeing and traveling.
<h3><em>Potential Disadvantages of OTR Trucking</em></h3>
OTR trucking can often require someone to stay on the road for very long periods of time. For those with families or obligations at home, that time spent away can become a problem. In addition, you may find yourself in the cab of your truck for much of that time you're away.

On very long hauls, you may not find any opportunities to get out of the truck. Not all people can handle that type of solitude or have the discipline to handle it while keeping themselves focused on the task at hand.

Of course, a lot of this will depend on the assignment. Going out for a week isn't the same as going out for several months. Also, you'll have the final say on what jobs you will accept.

Many OTR drivers drive company trucks. However, many of them also purchase their own, since the pay is more because you own the truck and not the company.  When looking to purchase your own unit, you need to choose a truck that can give you some room and maybe some amenities for when you're on the road. Also, make sure it is fuel efficient and reliable for long trips. Make sure you keep the long haul in mind when looking at trucks for your business.
<h2>What Is Regional Trucking?</h2>
Regional trucking involves keeping your driving to a particular region of the country. You may still have to cross state lines and go long distances, which makes regional trucking similar to OTR trucking.

Regional trucking can involve a large area, such as the New England states or the Midwest. You can still find yourself on the road for several days at a time, but your routes will remain in a territory you're probably at least a little familiar with.
<h3><em>Advantages of Regional Trucking</em></h3>
Employers often consider regional miles the same way they look at OTR mileage. You can build your resume and reputation without traveling across the country to do so.

Regional trucking also allows you to stay relatively closer to home. In some cases, you can find job opportunities that still allow you to get back home for weekends or more frequently. This can make for an ideal situation if you have a family and obligations at home that need your attention more frequently.

Regional truckers can still make good money, mainly because they still commit to longer hauls. Also, if you love to travel, you can still do so, just not as broadly as you would with OTR trucking.
<h3><em>Potential Disadvantages of Regional Trucking</em></h3>
Employers generally expect regional drivers to move quickly and to take on repeat loads. You will find yourself going back and forth during the week running hauls for companies that assume you can make tight deadlines because you technically don’t travel too far.

Once again, you have the most control over what jobs you take, and not all jobs are the same. You may find good-paying work that leaves you with some downtime. Nevertheless, new owner/operators will feel a lot of pressure to build up their profiles quickly, and regional driving jobs can help with that.

With regional trucking, you'll need to look for a truck that can handle a lot of back-and-forth driving. You also need to consider the atmospheric conditions of the region you will spend most of your time in. Choose a semi that's good with your locality's weather and typical driving conditions.

Your business plan and truck choice should consider the type of trucking you will do.

This can vary among local or regional authorities.

The classes range from 1–8.  Trucks are also classified more broadly by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), which classifies groups by light duty (1–2) , medium duty (3–6), and heavy duty (7–8). A commercial driver's license (CDL) is generally required to operate heavy duty trucks.<!--more-->

Which of the following buying options is best for you depends on the specifics of your business and situation.<!--more-->
<h2>Purchase Outright</h2>
Businesses that have the financial means to do so can purchase a used semitruck outright by writing a check for the truck.

This option is typically available to businesses that have substantial funds available because used semitrucks can cost between <a href=""https://www.costowl.com/automotive/auto-semi-truck-used-cost.html"">$15,000 and $100,000</a>. Some may be even more. For businesses that have this type of money available, though, purchasing outright offers a couple of benefits.

First, a truck that you buy outright doesn't add to a business's debt. Some businesses may not want to take on debt at all, and those that are comfortable with debt might still not want to use it to purchase a truck. Instead, they may prefer to reserve their borrowing ability for other investments they want to make.

Second, businesses that avoid loans don't have to pay interest. Avoiding interest both yields substantial long-term savings and eases a company's monthly cash flow.

Don't feel bad if you're unable to purchase a truck outright, many businesses and owner-operators can't afford this option. If you are in a position to buy a truck upfront, though, consider whether the benefits make sense for your business. Avoiding debt and interest makes sense in a lot of situations, but there are times when you're better off if the capital is available for something else.
<h2>Finance with a Loan</h2>
A traditional loan makes it possible to pay much less than a semitruck's full up-front price and still eventually own the truck outright. While there are requirements to qualify for a loan, these are widely available to both businesses and owner-operators in the industry.

Without loans, ownership would be unattainable for many businesses — and ownership has advantages. Once a business pays off a used semitruck loan, the business benefits in several ways:
<ul>
 	<li>Cash flow improves since the business no longer makes monthly loan payments.</li>
 	<li>Profitability increases since the business doesn't pay interest any more.</li>
 	<li>Overall worth goes up since the business now owns a substantial asset.</li>
</ul>
Additionally, the business can choose to sell the truck and pocket the sale price after you have repaid the truck's loan. If your business sells the truck before the loan is repaid, any equity that's built up can be pocketed.

Businesses that want to qualify for a used semitruck loan typically need a credit score of at least <a href=""https://www.pedigreetrucksales.com/how-to-get-a-loan-for-a-semi-truck/"">600</a> and 660 may be required by some lenders. If you don't have this high a credit score, however, you might still be able to get a loan by offering alternative collateral against the loan or getting a cosigner who has the required credit score.

If you eventually want the benefits that come with ownership, a loan is likely the most realistic way to make an actual purchase. Even before your business generates enough revenue to build up substantial savings, you can use a loan to begin moving toward complete ownership of a truck.
<h2>Buy Through a Capital Lease</h2>
Capital leases are technically leases or rental agreements, but they’re specifically designed to be a path toward ownership.

In a capital lease agreement, a business doesn't merely pay for use of the leased vehicle but also gets full ownership rights of the vehicle for the entirety of the lease. This means the business is responsible for maintenance and repairs. The business also gets to write off those expenses, insurance premiums, and asset depreciation, though.

At the end of a capital lease, the leasing business is extended a bargain purchase option. This means that the business can buy the leased truck for a below-fair-market price once the lease ends. Because the price is below fair-market value, businesses often take advantage of this option and purchase the vehicle.

By rule, capital leases must last for at least 75 percent of a truck's expected life span according to Investopedia.

The tax advantages of ownership often make this leasing option attractive for smaller businesses and owner-operators. If you aren't able to get a traditional loan, this type of lease can provide many of the same benefits even though it's structured differently. It might even be preferable to a loan, as the length of a capital lease makes the monthly payments quite low.
<h2>Rent Through Operating Lease</h2>
A more traditional lease agreement is the operating lease route, in which a business essentially rents access to a used semitruck on a long-term basis. The lease documents outline how the truck can be used.

Because an operating lease doesn't convey ownership costs, your business might not have to worry about repairs under this type of agreement. You should consult a specific lease's document to find out whether you or the lessor would be responsible for repairs.

Operating leases that require the lessor to pay for repairs are a good option if you don't have much capital for unexpected breakdowns.

We get asked the question all the time: “Should a first -time truck buyer be scared about buying a used truck?” You might be surprised to hear this from a used truck sales company but the answer is “yes”! As with any big decision, discretion and knowledge is the key to minimizing the fear and apprehension associated with buying used or even new equipment.<!--more-->

This is a big decision that affects you, your family, income, lifestyle and future. Everything is wrapped up into this decision. Get the decision right and it can pay off significantly. Get it wrong and the story could be entirely different.

Doing your homework is key to purchasing used equipment. There are several things to take into consideration when buying a used truck. Every reputable dealer will say they went over the truck in detail, and that they’ve thoroughly inspected it. But are they just saying that or do they have proof to back up what they are saying about their units? What steps are they taking to stand behind those units? Is there some initial warranty that comes with the truck? Was the inspection done by a neutral third-party that accurately represents the condition of the truck and removes bias from the inspection process? Or was it inspected by the dealership that is banking on you coming back to them for repairs after the sale?

Test driving a truck you’re considering buying is necessary when you’re going through the process. A fifteen mile trip to get a feel for a potential purchase is great, but the variables change when you put weight behind it. What kind of protection options do you have from a dealership and/or warranty company to ensure that your success will be maintained when something happens? Proper protection with warranties and a dealership’s standard protection plans at the point of purchase are very important factors to consider. You should do your work learning about the dealership, the products they offer and the products they sell. These products are important to success for drivers whether purchasing new or used.

A used truck still has a useful life. It may have dings, dents, scratches and flaws but it still has productive business value. You just should have a healthy amount of fear about any major life decision, including becoming an owner-operator. How you protect yourself with warranties, how diligent you are in learning about the unit you’re investing in and how much consideration you take into who you do business with are things you can do to make sure you’re setting yourself up for success on the road.

What’s the first question a used truck buyer should ask a dealer?

The first question is typically “what’s your best price?” There are several other questions that people will start with about inventory, financing, their warranty programs or what a truck sales company does to their trucks before selling them.<!--more-->

Honestly, every dealer is going to talk about their multi-point truck inspections, the shops they use for repairs. No dealer is every going to say “you know we knew there were problems with this truck but just decided to put a band-aid on it.”

No truck dealer is going to admit to that, so are those the kinds of questions that used truck purchasers should be asking? What should they be looking for with their dealer? Transparency. When you ask for documentation o n what they know about the truck and what they’ve done with it, can the provide it? Is their paperwork backing up what they say? Do they provide contact information for you to get clarity on what services have been performed on a truck? 

As far as financing is concerned, everyone has their own unique financing process. Make sure it’s a company that actually wants to see you succeed and isn’t benefitting from you defaulting. Does the financing company have a grace period that if things go bad, they aren’t immediately going after your truck – that want you to keep running.

As far as price, it doesn’t take long to find how competitive the pricing is on a unit. There are prices listed across the internet at a wide variety of spots to help you get a good understanding of the price of the truck. If they’re in line with what’s out there, it comes down to the condition of the truck. It comes down to your comfort level with the unit and the people you’re working with. 

The best question to ask a salesman when you’re purchasing a used truck is “Are you ready to back up what you say with documentation and written proof?” Everything comes down to how willing a company is to provide you with enough information to make an important decision like purchasing your next used truck.

There are a lot of things that could raise a red flag but one of the first things to think about is when you go into or call the dealership, make sure you’re not being pushed automatically into something you’re not comfortable with. If they’re not listening to you or listening to your unique situation, that can often be the first warning sign when working with a dealer or salesperson.<!--more--> 

The truth is an OEM or a reputable dealer (UTA: Used Truck Association members might be a good place to start for this) that’s been around for a long time have years and years of proving best business practices or else they wouldn’t have stuck around for as long as they have. It’s hard to be dismissive of a customer’s needs and survive in the truck sales industry.

Make sure the dealership you’re working with is listening. If they aren’t trying to understand your situation then they don’t have your best interest in mind when steering you towards a major purchasing decision like a used truck. They should be probing you for information about how they can meet your trucking needs – not talking you into something. 

You deserve to have your questions and concerns answered. You deserve to have a clear understanding of that dealer’s process from start to finish. You deserve to have your needs met. Purchasing your next truck is a life changing decision for truck drivers – the process should be clear and simple. 

If a salesperson you’re talking to seems to have already forgot what you said, if they’re already have a predetermined destination for where they want to take you, get out of there. This is too big of a decision to not have your interests put first. Try to find someone with your best interests, whether it’s us at Arrow or someone else.

The buying process can be difficult but it should be easy if you have a plan. Price is obviously very important, and you shouldn’t leave a dealership without asking their best price. But don’t ignore the important questions beyond just that will be the difference between success and disaster on the road.<!--more--> 

Don’t neglect important questions in the decision making process like has the truck been thoroughly inspected? Has the truck been checked out to make sure it passes DOT and PM service? Has the regeneration been run fully to make sure there are no problems coming down the line? Are there any active or inactive codes? 

Checking out the truck thoroughly before signing on the dotted line is critical. Everything happens fast, and owner-operators should be excited to get out on the road and start making money – that’s why many set out to be their own boss. But before you commit to a truck, the best thing to do is slow down and make sure you’re diligent inspecting the truck and make sure you’re comfortable with your purchase and are testing the necessary functions. 

As a truck dealer, we work hard to our due diligence on the trucks we sell. But we’re not you. There might be things specific to your truck needs and your business that you might see that we don’t. A truck purchase and decisions you make surrounding that purchase should be tailor fit to your needs. Before signing any paperwork or filling out a credit application, take time to make sure it is the truck to best fit your needs. 

On the financing side, the same logic applies. Make sure you’re comfortable with it and is something you can reasonably do. Dealers like Arrow offer extended warranties at great value. Not all protection is created equal. Make sure your protection allows you to receive help from any authorized dealer nationwide – you never know where you’ll go. Make sure they cover wear out and failure of parts to make sure there is no loopholes in their coverage that should absolutely be taken care of. 

When you’re looking for your next truck purchase it all comes down to comfort. Make sure you’re comfortable with the truck, the financing and the protection.

"HAZMAT Certification | Arrow Truck Sales","Do you want to become a certified HAZMAT driver? Discover the answers to four frequently asked questions about HAZMAT certification.",60,3,,,,,,,"Resource Center",,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/4-faq-about-hazmat-certification.jpg,4-faq-about-hazmat-certification.jpg,"E:\Sites\arrowtruck_com\blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/4-faq-about-hazmat-certification.jpg",712,4-faq-about-hazmat-certification,,,,,,,,,,,,,710,"<img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-712"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/4-faq-about-hazmat-certification-300x200.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""200"" />

Hazardous materials (HAZMAT) are substances that have the potential to harm one's health. These materials can also damage property and the environment. The danger hazardous materials pose means they require careful transportation.

<!--more-->

Examples of hazardous materials include explosives, gases, radioactive materials, poisons, corrosive materials, and flammable or combustible liquids or solids. Because hazardous materials require special care, truck drivers who transport them need to obtain HAZMAT certification.

For truck drivers who want to know more, discover the answers to four frequently asked questions about HAZMAT certification.
<h2>How Do Truck Drivers Obtain HAZMAT Certification?</h2>
In order to obtain HAZMAT certification, a truck driver must first have their Class A commercial driver's license (CDL). A Class A CDL allows truckers to drive tractor-trailers, truck and trailer combinations, and tanker vehicles. Once a truck driver has their Class A CDL, they must meet certain requirements to obtain HAZMAT certification.

These <u><a href=""https://www.truckerstraining.com/become-hazmat-driver/"">requirements</a></u> include being at least 21 years of age, providing proof of legal residence or citizenship, and completing a medical and eye exam. Truck drivers also need to pass a HAZMAT knowledge test. This written exam is available through the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) or the Transportation Security Administration (TSA).

The HAZMAT knowledge exam tests truck drivers on state and federal HAZMAT regulations and how to safely transport, load, and unload hazardous materials. The HAZMAT application fee usually costs between $80 and $110. The application process also includes a TSA background check that can take up to 60 days.

Criminal convictions that involve terrorism, espionage, violent crimes, and treason will disqualify an applicant from obtaining HAZMAT certification.
<h2>What Endorsements Do HAZMAT Truck Drivers Need?</h2>
For HAZMAT certification, truck drivers should acquire certain CDL endorsements:
<ul>
 	<li><em>Hazardous materials endorsement</em>. This endorsement shows up as an H on a truck driver's license. The hazardous materials endorsement enables HAZMAT truck drivers to transport, load, and unload hazardous materials. All HAZMAT truck drivers are required to have this endorsement.</li>
 	<li><em>Tank vehicle endorsement</em>. This endorsement shows up as an N on the truck driver's license. The tank vehicle endorsement enables HAZMAT truck drivers to operate a tank vehicle, which truck drivers use to transport hazardous materials, especially liquids and liquefied gases.</li>
 	<li><em>Tanker/HAZMAT combo endorsement</em>. This endorsement shows up as an X on a truck driver's license. This combination endorsement allows truck drivers to transport HAZMAT materials and operate a tanker. This endorsement is highly recommended for all HAZMAT truck drivers.</li>
</ul>
Please note that truck drivers can apply for HAZMAT certification and their tanker endorsement at the same time, but they will need to take two different knowledge exams.

The tanker endorsement test consists of 20 to 30 questions. Some of the topics on the tanker endorsement test include how to safely haul tankers and how fast to drive on a curve with a tanker. The test will also quiz the applicant on their knowledge of baffles, bulkheads, and smooth bore tanks.
<h2>Do Truck Drivers Need to Renew HAZMAT Certification?</h2>
As with a CDL, truck drivers must renew their HAZMAT certification on a regular basis. In most states, truck drivers need to renew their certification before it expires, which is usually <u><a href=""https://www.hazmatschool.com/blog/how-to-stay-on-top-of-hazmat-training-and-certification/"">five years</a></u> from the approval date.

If a truck driver does not renew their HAZMAT certification, they will no longer be able to transport hazardous materials. Truck drivers who renew HAZMAT certification need to submit new fingerprints to the TSA, which they usually need to do by appointment.

To renew HAZMAT certification, some states also require truck drivers to complete the knowledge test again.
<h2>How Much Money Do HAZMAT Truck Drivers Make?</h2>
A HAZMAT truck driver is one of the highest paid occupations in the trucking industry. The average pay for HAZMAT truck drivers in the United States is <u><a href=""https://www.salary.com/research/salary/posting/hazmat-tanker-driver-salary"">$61,982</a></u>. Some HAZMAT truck drivers earn a salary of more than $70,000. The salary is dependent upon a variety of factors including:
<ul>
 	<li>Education</li>
 	<li>Certifications</li>
 	<li>Experience</li>
 	<li>Additional skills</li>
</ul>
Truck drivers who obtain their tanker endorsement in addition to their HAZMAT certification have the potential to make the most money.

Besides having a good-paying job, HAZMAT drivers should not have a hard time finding work. According to the most recent statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the job outlook for HAZMAT drivers is expected to grow by 17 percent. This job growth is much faster than average compared to other occupations.

The most successful and highest-paying HAZMAT drivers understand all the laws and regulations pertaining to the transportation of hazardous materials. Successful HAZMAT truck drivers also pay close attention to detail, are always aware of the task at hand, are willing to enhance their driving skills, and learn safe driving techniques.

However, the first question they should be asking is how well this particular piece of equipment will perform while meeting your hauling needs and requirements. <!--more-->

In other words, what application was the truck built for? Was the truck actually <em>designed</em> to do what you need it to do? This is the most important question, since if the truck does not fit your application, it can cost you a lot of money! Getting the truck that was built to do what you need it to do will put more money in your pocket over time.

OTR tractors are built to many different specifications, specific to the fleet that orders them from the OEM. Day cabs or sleeper.  Long haul or regional.  Single or tandem axle. Chassis configuration is also specification being considered when spec’ing a truck for a certain application

What is a 6x2 configuration?  It has a “dead axle” in the back with an air bag to maintain cargo weight but it does not pull.  Automatic weight transfer system uses air sensing valves to inflate the air bag if the front wheels don’t spin will deflate to put more weight on front axle for better grip and traction.

What are the advantages? First of all, it saves approximately 500 lbs. in truck weight for extra cargo weight. Less weight also means better fuel economy and better fuel economy saves money.  Second, since the front axle does all the work, it saves wear and tear on the rear tires. Third, since there is no rear axle, there is less requires maintenance on a drive shaft and/or u-joints. So, the primary advantage is lower of ownership.

Additionally, it can still pull the same weight. There is no loss of horsepower or torque since the GAWR and GVWR rating on a truck is based on the axel capacity. Fleets who have switched their tractors to 6x2 axle configurations have realized up to 2.5% - 3.5% fuel reduction, among other benefits.

But also realize this configuration may not be right for you. Are you taking your truck off-road or hauling for land-fills or logging?  Then this is the wrong truck for you. It is strictly a highway truck designed for flat, hard surfaces. If you buy the right truck…you win. Wrong truck…you’ll will regret it. Other factors to consider is where do you haul. This configuration is more popular in the southern region of the U.S. and especially great for regional hauls.

"Wireless Carriers and Smartphones for Trucking | Arrow Truck Sales","OTR trucking can mean long hours on the road and days away from home. Here are some tips for choosing a carrier and smartphone for your OTR trucking needs.",60,,,,,,,,"Resource Center",,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/phone.jpg,phone.jpg,"E:\Sites\arrowtruck_com\blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/phone.jpg",748,phone,,,,,,,,,,,,,745,"<img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-748"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/phone-300x200.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""200"" />OTR trucking can mean long hours on the road and days away from home. While you're out there, you need a way to communicate with people, whether it's family or clients. Here are some tips for choosing a carrier and smartphone for your OTR trucking needs.

<!--more-->
<h2><strong>Choose a Carrier With Coverage Along Your Typical Routes</strong></h2>
Before looking at phone models or anything else, look at the coverage maps of the available carriers in your area. If you find yourself in a dead spot, it won't matter what type of smartphone or service you have. Places with spotty coverage can become just as bad since you'll have a faulty connection you can't rely on.

Look for high-speed coverage for both voice and data along the routes you plan to take, areas you plan to work most in, and places you might have to travel through. The larger the coverage spread, the better.

Carriers that also offer Wi-Fi calling capabilities natively or tethering can also look appealing to an OTR trucker. Tethering features allow you to use your smartphone as a modem to connect a laptop or tablet to the internet when you need to. Some carriers refer to this functionality as using your phone as a “hot spot.”

Good coverage also helps keep the potential for roaming to a minimum. Having roaming options available in an emergency isn't a bad idea, but finding a carrier that covers the right areas can help you mitigate the need for roaming.

If you do choose a carrier with roaming features, try to find one that doesn't charge for roaming or gives you an allotment of roaming minutes you can use before roaming charges kick in. However, if a carrier offers free roaming, make sure they don't charge you for connecting through a cell tower that's not part of the carrier's network.
<h2><strong>Choose a Plan That Makes Sense for You and Your Business</strong></h2>
Carriers offer a lot of choices when it comes to phone plans these days. An OTR trucker will likely need a voice and data plan that won't run out when they need it most. You may find yourself tempted by an unlimited plan, but look at the fine print before choosing such an option.

Some carriers can limit data on an unlimited plan during certain times or peak hours. If you have an idea of how much data and voice service you will need, try to find a plan to fit your habits and needs.

If you choose a postpaid plan, you can find yourself locked into your plan for at least a year. A prepaid plan can sometimes work better if you're sure you will have the coverage, minutes, and data allowances you require for a month.
<h2><strong>Choose a Smartphone That Can Handle Frequent Handling</strong></h2>
You'll likely have your phone with you in all types of conditions that can damage the phone or its electronics, so a sturdy smartphone is the best option. Look at reviews for smartphones to see what the tech community has to say about the durability or ruggedness of a particular model. Modern handsets can meet a lot of rugged requirements, including:
<ul>
 	<li>Protection from moisture and water</li>
 	<li>Protection from shock and vibration</li>
 	<li>Protection from the intrusion of dust and particles</li>
 	<li>Protection from extreme elements or temperatures</li>
</ul>
You can find all these features while still having a large screen, plenty of storage, and good battery life. The last thing an OTR trucker needs is for their phone to go on the fritz the second they take it out of the truck.

No matter what smartphone you choose, make sure you pick up a sturdy case for it. The more you can protect the phone while still having an easy time using it, the better.
<h2><strong>Choose a Smartphone That You Can Put to Work</strong></h2>
Your smartphone can do a lot more than make calls and cruise the internet. You can, and should, use your phone as a tool to help you with your OTR trucking operations. There are many available downloadable applications on the market today that are designed specifically the trucking industry. A quick online search will provide plenty of offerings. The app markets contain a ton of trucking-related apps that can help you do things like:
<ul>
 	<li>Keep track of daily business and expenditures</li>
 	<li>Schedule loads and update clients</li>
 	<li>Look up the weather, traffic, and fuel prices</li>
</ul>
Knowing what you would like your smartphone to do can help you choose the right model. You can find yourself bogged down by specs, but looking at some of the apps available and their requirements can help you make a more informed choice.

No matter what type of smartphone you end up with, make sure your tractor has the proper inputs, outputs, and connections to allow you to use it to its full capabilities. Keep that in mind when you're choosing a semi-truck.

"Roadside Inspections | Arrow Truck Sales","For owner-operators, roadside inspections are an unavoidable fact of life. Read here to learn a few things you might not know about roadside inspections.",30,,,,,,,,"Resource Center",,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/truck.jpg,truck.jpg,"E:\Sites\arrowtruck_com\blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/truck.jpg",751,truck,,,,,,,,,,,,,750,"<img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-751"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/truck-300x200.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""200"" />For owner-operators, roadside inspections are an unavoidable fact of life. Even if you've gone through them a thousand times, you can still fall afoul of inspections if you don't show care. On top of that, the laws regarding inspections change periodically, so that's something else to remain cognizant of. Here are a few things you might not know about roadside inspections.

<!--more-->
<ol>
 	<li>
<h2><strong> Roadside Inspections Can Exist at the State and Federal Level</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
The more familiar DOT roadside inspections aren't the only inspections you may have to go through. Some states also have a roadside inspection program that comes with rules you must adhere to. Even some smaller geographic localities, such as counties or cities, can have rules that show up during an inspection.

You need to know the overarching federal roadside inspection rules, but you also need to make sure you understand what the states you pass through may expect during an inspection. Where a state inspection falls short of meeting the federal requirements, you will have to make sure you receive an inspection from another source that does meet FMCSA standards.

The good news is that a state inspection that meets federal criteria will allow you to receive recognition of that inspection in other states. This helps with periodic inspection programs, as your qualified state inspection can satisfy all requirements without you needing to go through another inspection as you travel.
<ol start=""2"">
 	<li>
<h2><strong> Roadside Inspections Can Occur at Several Places</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
You may know about the permanent facilities along highways that conduct roadside inspections, but you may not know about other areas that can spring an inspection on you. Roadside inspections aren't always random, and finding yourself needing to suddenly go through one can become an issue for an unprepared driver.

For example, mobile inspection sites exist and so do inspection areas at truck stops and other places. You need to make sure you can handle an inspection at any time, no matter where you're at or where you're going.
<ol start=""3"">
 	<li>
<h2><strong> Roadside Inspections Can Happen in Various Ways</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
A roadside inspection can include a light look or a heavily detailed process. <a href=""https://keeptruckin.com/blog/roadside-inspections-guide/"">Eight levels</a> of roadside inspections exist, but for semitruck drivers, only some of them are relevant. These levels include:
<ol>
 	<li>North American Standard Inspection</li>
 	<li>Walk-Around Driver or Vehicle Inspection</li>
 	<li>Driver or Credential Inspection</li>
 	<li>Special Inspection</li>
 	<li>Vehicle-Only Inspection</li>
 	<li>Transuranic Waste and Highway Route Controlled Quantities of Radioactive Material Inspection</li>
 	<li>Jurisdictional Mandated Commercial Vehicle Inspection</li>
 	<li>North American Standard Electronic Inspection</li>
</ol>
The Level 1 inspection is the most common and comprehensive of the list. Preparing for a Level 1 inspection can typically help you with any other level or type of inspection you come across. This inspection will look at your license, logs, permits, and other documents relevant to your ability to operate a semi carrying the type of load you're carrying.

The inspector will also look at important vehicle components:
<ul>
 	<li>Braking systems</li>
 	<li>Exhaust system</li>
 	<li>Coupling devices</li>
 	<li>Tractor and trailer bodies</li>
 	<li>Fuel system</li>
 	<li>Lights</li>
 	<li>Suspension and related components</li>
 	<li>Steering</li>
 	<li>Wheels and tires</li>
 	<li>Cargo securement</li>
</ul>
The inspector may check other things as needed. However, having everything in order can prepare you for up to the third level of inspection types.

The Level 4 inspection only looks at a particular item or aspect of the driver or the truck. The Level 6 inspection only concerns controlled or hazardous materials and whether you're adhering to the laws regarding moving such materials.

The Level 7 inspections have to do with making sure you're in compliance with local regulations that pertain to commercial vehicles. Level 8 inspections aren't as well-known because they're relatively new. This inspection is a fully electronic one and looks at electronic data validation. Electronic validation can mean your GPS coordinates, verification of any electronic documentation, carrier information, and other data.

<h2><strong> Roadside Inspections Can Help You Determine Which Truck to Buy</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
Understanding what's expected of you during a roadside inspection can also help you make an informed decision when buying a new or used semitruck or trailer. For example, it can help to have a truck you can easily maintain and keep in good condition.

Such a truck will help when it comes to your daily safety checks and your routine upkeep schedule. Vehicles that you can keep clean and uncluttered can also help when it comes to inspections. In a similar fashion, you can choose a trailer that's right for the type of hauls you plan to make.

As the trailer plays a strong part in roadside inspections, you can choose one that can accommodate the typical weight and dimensions of what you haul. You will also want a trailer with the highest compatibility with your tractor. Inspections do look at the couplings and whether the tractor and trailer interact smoothly with each other.

If you're sta<img class=""size-medium wp-image-756 alignleft"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/buying-used-semitruck-saves-money-300x169.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""169"" />rting out as an owner-operator truck driver, the truck you purchase is one of your first and most important decisions. While a new truck may be appealing, a used semitruck will be more affordable — and the savings it provides will help you as you get started. Here are the various ways that buying a used truck will save you money.

<!--more-->
<h2>Lower the Initial Purchase Price</h2>
Most obviously, you won't have to spend nearly as much on a used truck as you would on a new one. New semitrucks often range between <u><a href=""https://www.costowl.com/automotive/auto-semi-truck-used-cost.html"">$80,000 and $150,000</a></u>, and they can reach $200,000 or more if they have a lot of upgrades and custom features on board. Used trucks similarly vary in price, but they often can be a fraction of the cost of new trucks.

Regardless of whether you purchase your truck outright or finance it, if you pay less at the time of purchase, you can reap multiple benefits.

You'll be able to get into your own rig sooner since you don't have to save up as much, and your risk exposure will be less because you have a smaller amount invested in the rig. This lower risk exposure makes it easier to pivot if your initial intended business plan needs to be revised, which is better done sooner rather than later if you’re self-employed.
<h2>Reduce Interest Payments</h2>
Assuming you do finance your semitruck, you'll end up paying much less in interest if you purchase a lower-priced used one. Even if the interest rates on a new truck loan and a used truck loan are identical, the smaller balance on the used loan will result in substantially reduced interest. Over the course of a loan's duration, the total savings can amount to quite a lot.

As an example, consider a new truck loan for $150,000 and a used truck loan for $80,000. Also, assume both loans had an annualized percentage rate (APR) of just 5 percent. In just the first year, the new loan will result in interest payments of $7,5000 and the used loan will have interest payments of $4,000. That's a $3,5000 difference in only one year.

The difference in total interest paid becomes even more pronounced over the multiple years that a loan lasts, and it's much more if the interest rate is higher. As of August 20109, some semitruck loans had APRs as high as <u><a href=""https://www.fundera.com/business-loans/guides/commercial-truck-financing"">30 percent</a></u> — which would more than quintuple the example's first-year savings.

Whatever you ultimately save by financing a used truck instead of a new one is money in your pocket. Interest is money that you pay and never see a return on, so you should always minimize it when you can.
<h2>Eliminate Federal Excise Tax</h2>
The decision to buy a used semitruck also eliminates the need to pay federal excise tax (FET) on the purchase. FET is a 12-percent federal tax on the initial sale of heavy commercial vehicles. Since the tax is only on the initial sale, it doesn't have to be paid on the sale of any used commercial vehicles.

Although this doesn't provide the long-term savings that reduced interest payments do, the elimination of FET is helpful. You'll likely save thousands of dollars since trucks cost tens or hundreds of thousands, and this savings comes when you need it most. Anyone who's starting a business could use an extra few thousand dollars as they get ready to begin operations.
<h2>Minimize Physical Damage Insurance Premiums</h2>
Since a used truck is inherently worth less than a new one, physical damage insurance premiums tend to be lower for used ones.

Physical damage insurance is the portion of a commercial truck insurance policy that covers the truck itself against damage in collisions and other incidents, and premiums for the protection are directly linked to a truck's value. When a truck costs less, insurers can charge less for the protection because their potential payout if the truck is totaled won't be as much.

How much you stand to save on these premiums depends on your truck's value, chosen limit and deductible, and many other factors.

You will save money each time you pay your truck insurance bill, though, and that will ease your cash flow. In an industry where owner-operators sometimes struggle to collect payments and need to cover expenses, even a slight cash flow benefit can have a big impact on month-to-month finances.
<h2>Save on Depreciation Costs</h2>
Finally, you'll save on depreciation as you use your semitruck if you drive a used one with miles already on it. The truck will depreciate at a slower rate than a new one will, and it won't depreciate as much in total value since it's worth less to start with.

Minimized depreciation costs won't help you on a weekly or monthly basis, but you will appreciate the savings whenever you decide to sell the rig.

,,30,,,,,,,,Uncategorized,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,761,"<img src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/scared-300x200.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""200"" class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-717"" />Modern commercial vehicle aftertreatment systems have dramatically reduced harmful vehicle emissions and helped improve our air quality. But since their initial introduction, these systems have also contributed to more instances of mechanical breakdown and therefore, downtime. Recent changes in aftertreatment technology have significantly improved performance and reduced the number of failures but still, some are leery of the potential for failure that the aftertreatment system may introduce. For example, when the truck is producing emissions in excess of what is allowed under the Clean Air Act, the aftertreatment will shut the truck down, even if it is otherwise in good working order.<!--more-->

To avoid a possible shut down, some in the trucking industry have been tempted to tamper with aftertreatment systems hoping to reduce or eliminate the possibility that the truck could stop operating due to the aftertreatment system. Aftertreatment systems are usually tampered with (often said to be ""deleted"") in one of two ways:

1)	By physical removal of components within the system, or
2)	Through re-programming the Aftertreatment Control Module (ACM), allowing the system to operate outside of regulatory standards

The temptation to circumvent the aftertreatment system's ability to ""regulate"" the operation of the truck is simply something you shouldn't do. In fact, tampering with the aftertreatment system in any way is a violation of federal law. Repair facilities who tamper with aftertreatment systems or perform repairs to trucks with improper aftertreatment systems risk heavy criminal and/or civil penalties. Similarly, owner-operators who tamper with their aftertreatment system can face those same penalties, along with the potential for losing their operating authority. In short, a good business can lose revenue or even potentially go out of business simply by tampering with an aftertreatment system.

Owner-operators also need to remember that most warranties have provisions that could void aftertreatment warranty coverage if the system has been tampered with. If that happens, they could end up paying the cost out of their pocket to have the aftertreatment restored to proper working order plus, still be subjected to paying fines for violation of the law.

Aftertreatment system failure can be one of the most expensive repairs you can make on a truck. Having aftertreatment warranty coverage is a smart way to limit your risk of high out of pocket repair costs. But also, take time to pay attention to this important part of your truck. If you're purchasing a used truck, make sure that the aftertreatment system, including the physical components and the ACM, is operating within required specifications. If your truck has problems with the aftertreatment system, check that the service facility follows all the right guidelines so your system functions properly and within industry standards.

Maintaining the day to day operation of the aftertreatment system on your truck is the right thing to do for our environment. But it also helps assure that your truck and your business keep running smoothly so you keep making money.

No business venture has a 100% success rate unfortunately. Owner-operators in the used truck industry are no exception to that face. The obstacles they face may be different than other industries, but they still incur the same risks most small business owners do. As a used truck sales company our goal is to help remove or assist with any barriers that may be in the way.<!--more-->

Fear of failure is something that is a big deal to our customers. The majority of our customers are drivers making the jump from being a company driver into ownership.  There are unforeseen things that can get in the way of a new owner-operator’s pursuit of a better life. 

There are three key things that often define the success or failure an owner operator:

<strong>Truck selection</strong>

Coming from a used truck dealer, this is important. You go to the dealer, test drive the unit and feel comfortable making the investment but the honeymoon is short lived. Issue after issues starts popping up with your truck. If you’re not properly protected with coverage it can be an absolute back breaker coming out of the gate. For company drivers becoming owner-operators who may not have that nest egg for these expenses it can create a significant setback. Asking for truck history reports and any documentation on the unit you’re purchasing upfront plus purchasing the proper coverage can help you make the right business decision.

<strong>Load Source</strong>

We hear this more than anything else. Even if a truck driver has the right work ethic and has picked the right truck, it doesn’t matter what they do if they don’t pick the right haul source or carrier. If they are continually shortening work and messing with loads or rate it doesn’t matter how disciplined you are to that point. One successful driver we spoke to said he wished he had been as diligent choosing a load sources as he was choosing a truck.  Load source is critical to the success of drivers. 

<strong>Learning curve</strong>

There is a big learning curve when you make the jump from being a company driver to an owner-operator. When you’re a company driver if there’s an issue with the truck it’s the company’s fault. When you become an owner-operator, there’s no one to call when trouble arises – it’s on the owner-operator. They’re now responsible for money management, time management and crisis management that they may not have been as actively involved in prior to making the jump to being their own boss. 

The good news is the majority of owner-operators that go out on their own are able to adjust quickly and find success on the road. When you do a thorough search process to pick the right truck, align with a quality load source and prepare yourself for the new responsibilities it leads to success.

But it can be a team operation if you partner with one or more other drivers to share the driving and the benefits.

<!--more-->

Should you take up team driving or continue on your own? Here are a few good indicators that you might find a partner the perfect fit.
<ol>
 	<li>
<h2><strong> You Get Along With Your Co-Driver</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
When you share the work of driving a truck, you also have to spend a lot of time with the other driver. While one of you will likely be in the sleeping compartment while the other is driving, both drivers will still be in each other's space far longer than they may expect. There will be more noise, more movement, and more stuff in the cab.

This close proximity and shared decision-making is one key reason why many team drivers are real-life couples. While you don't have to be a couple, you should be able to enjoy one another's company and get along comfortably — including handling disagreements without a third party to intervene. Two drivers who already work together and have a close bond could be an ideal pair.

You can mitigate conflicts and boost privacy when you create ground rules both of you can agree on and continue to have an open dialogue, of course. But you'll need to work that out and you may face an adjustment period that can test both parties.
<ol start=""2"">
 	<li>
<h2><strong> You Can Share Profits</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
A reduced workload is great, but team drivers each must wrestle with reduced individual earnings as well. After all, two people will split the per-mile pay. An owner-operator would have to weigh the revenue loss against the potential for longer trips, more loads, and time to focus on other aspects of their business. Ideally, you'll have a healthy profit margin and a good business plan.

How much profit you share depends on your contract with the co-driver. You'll need to determine how to handle the expenses and financial responsibility for the truck as well as the business obligations of each party. Before entering into an agreement — even an informal or verbal one — you would do well to consult with an attorney and an accountant.
<ol start=""3"">
 	<li>
<h2><strong> You Can Give Up Control</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
Are you one to comfortably share many of the decisions involved when you’re on the road, operating your trucks, and running a business? If your co-driver needs a break when you don't, you may be obliged to stop. If one person has fuel stop preferences or likes to drive during certain hours, you may need to compromise. And two experienced drivers need to trust one another's driving skills and maintenance choices.

Owner-operators like the freedom and control that comes with being their own boss. But team drivers must work together and genuinely respect their partners' choices. This mindset is an adjustment, but it could be a profitable one if you can learn to let some things go and trust your partner.
<ol start=""4"">
 	<li>
<h2><strong> You Can Sleep Anywhere</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
Don't overlook the physical benefits of letting someone else do the driving. The purpose of team driving is to provide rest and break periods for each person without having to stop the truck. That means you can take your breaks — and get your requisite amount of sleep — while the truck is chugging down the road. If you can tune out the road, get sleep in any conditions, and enjoy private time in motion, team driving will be a great fit.
<ol start=""5"">
 	<li>
<h2><strong> You Want to Grow Your Business</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
Any business person who shares the workload with a partner has more opportunities to grow that business through their shared efforts. Team drivers can often stay out on the road for weeks at a time and operate a nearly 24/7 business. If you've wondered how you might grow your business without investing huge sums in new trucks, contractors, or employees, using existing assets could be an ideal solution.

Along with more opportunities, you may also see better opportunities when you’re part of a team. Many individual shippers and carriers like to work with driving teams because they are considered a safer bet than sole drivers. You could qualify for priority loads, higher pay per mile, mileage guarantees, and safety incentives. And you may find yourself more attractive to individual shipping clients.

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to whether or not to pursue team driving. Many truckers find that it adds great new opportunities and provides some needed companionship on the road. Others may not be ready to share their cab — for weeks on end — with someone else.

While most trucks are built to handle long hours and long distances on the road, some specialized trucks are necessary for warehouse and unloading operations. These specialized trucks are often smaller and more suited for a specific area like a warehouse or yard. One of the most important trucks for yard operations is the yard spotter.

Yard spotters, also known as terminal trucks, yard trucks, yard jockeys, mules, or tractors, are necessary for many unloading and loading tasks. These sturdy, single-person vehicles are perfect for warehouse and cargo yard use.

Yard spotters can transfer trailers and shipping containers within a yard from one location to another. Larger operations may need fleets solely comprised of yard spotters. Whether you have a large or small fleet, you will likely need a yard spotter for your site. Here are a few ways to pick the best yard spotter for your needs.
<h2><strong>Maneuverability and Steady Speed</strong></h2>
The best yard spotters offer easy access to the trailer connections that attach the cab to the trailer it is moving. While most truck cabs only have doors on the side, yard spotters usually have a full-height door in the back, which allows the driver access to the rear connections. In addition, yard spotters usually have a shorter wheelbase with a tight turning radius.

The shorter wheelbase means that the truck sits lower to the ground. The lower position means that the wheels can turn more tightly without the cab tipping or losing balance. This allows for more maneuverability while still maintaining a sturdy construction, which allows yard spotters to hook up to and haul heavy trailers.

Since yard spotters mostly stay in the yard, they do not need to go fast. Instead, the best yard spotters need to be able to maintain a slow, steady speed while still having enough maneuverability to make tight turns.
<h2><strong>Heating and Air Conditioning</strong></h2>
Heating and air conditioning weren't as common in yard spotters just a few years ago, but these days they are standard in most yard trucks. While older models may not offer it, these amenities improve retention and comfort for drivers. In addition, because yard spotters are so small, their engines don't produce a lot of heat, so consider getting a secondary heating system for winter seasons.
<h2><strong>Eco-Friendly Options</strong></h2>
Certain tractors are specifically designed to reduce the environmental impact of the truck. In addition to less power usage, certain greener options can actually make the yard safer for drivers.

For example, LED lights not only use less power, but they provide more visibility for the driver and more safety for other truckers in the yard than regular incandescent or halogen lamps. This makes the trucks both safer and more functional.
<h2><strong>Lifting Capabilities</strong></h2>
Yard spotters are often smaller than other trucks, but they need to be able to haul much bigger and heavier trucks and trailers. Good yard spotters have a fifth-wheel coupling, a type of coupling that links the tractor or truck with the trailer. Fifth-wheel couplings offer better towing stability and allow the front axle assembly to pivot horizontally.

In addition, yard spotters usually have a specialized lifting mechanism that allows them to haul semi-trailers that have their legs in a lowered position. The lowered position of the legs allows the trailer to stand while uncoupled, and these legs usually have to be raised when connected to a truck or cab.

However, trailers can be hooked to a yard spotter without changing their leg position, which lowers the amount of time transfers take. Look for yard spotters that have continuously welded frames for the best experience in durability and lifting strength.
<h2><strong>Customizable Options</strong></h2>
Yard spotters have to be versatile, and this means that customization is important to longevity. Some trucks offer several variations that make it easy to find a model that fits your business's needs. Being able to customize seat height, interior space, and other elements of the car experience, like music and comfort, can make driving easier for the trucker.
<h2><strong>360-Degree Vision</strong></h2>
Unlike trucks that are used on the highway and that don't back up easily or turn sharply, yard spotters need to be able to turn and back up constantly. Because of this, you should find a spotter that offers clear 360-degree vision through the back and side windows.

Some customizations that help with visibility include a swiveling seat and roomy cab. This maximizes visibility, and, coupled with LED lights and customized seat height, makes the yard spotter more efficient and safe in the yard and around other trucks and drivers.

These are just a few of the main things to look for when picking the best yard spotter for your site.

Many truck drivers have serious health issues. One of the biggest health problems that truck drivers face is obesity. In fact, <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/trucking-obesity-high-risk-2018-5"">research</a> shows that about seven in 10 truckers are obese. About 17 percent of truck drivers are morbidly obese, which means they are 100 pounds over their normal weight.

<!--more-->

Long-haul truck drivers are especially at risk for health issues. Besides obesity, truck drivers can have hypertension and high cholesterol. Thankfully, truck drivers can do some things to combat these kinds of health issues.

Discover five ways for truckers to stay healthy on the road.
<ol>
 	<li>
<h2><strong> Stop Smoking</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
Many truck drivers smoke cigarettes. When a person smokes cigarettes, they increase their risk of acquiring the following health issues:
<ul>
 	<li>Cancer</li>
 	<li>Type 2 diabetes</li>
 	<li>Heart disease</li>
</ul>
Smoking cigarettes has also proven to be harmful to one's mental health. Smokers increase their chances of suffering with anxiety, depression, and irritability. Truck drivers who work around hazardous materials increase their chances of serious injury if they smoke near their truck and it explodes.

A truck driver can do many things to quit smoking. Some ways to quit include setting a date to stop cold turkey, cutting back slowly with the help of nicotine replacement, or asking their doctor for a prescription medication that helps lessen the addiction to nicotine.
<ol start=""2"">
 	<li>
<h2><strong> Eat Better  </strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
Unfortunately, one of the worst parts about being on the road is that healthy eating options are limited. While fast-food joints and truck stops offer a convenient and inexpensive place to eat, these food places don't always serve the most nutritious meals.

This makes it difficult for truck drivers who want to eat better. Despite the challenges to eat better, you do have some ways to do it. A few of them include the following:
<ul>
 	<li>Buy an oven that plugs into the cigarette lighter and use it to cook healthy meals.</li>
 	<li>Never skip breakfast.</li>
 	<li>Replace candy bars and doughnuts with healthy snacks, such as nuts and fresh fruit.</li>
</ul>
Sometimes, truck drivers cannot avoid fast food. If fast food is the only option to get some much-needed calories, never supersize the meal. Try to find the healthiest option on the menu, like a salad or grilled chicken sandwich.

If eating at a truck stop, order half a serving. Truckers can also practice portion control when they eat half their meal at the truck stop and save the rest for later. Taking leftovers on the road works especially well for truckers who have a small oven and also a cooler.
<ol start=""3"">
 	<li>
<h2><strong> Drink the Right Beverages</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
Along with eating the right foods, truck drivers also need to drink the right beverages. Truck drivers should choose beverages low in sugar and caffeine and high in electrolytes and other nutrients. Some healthier beverage options for truck drivers include milk, tea, carbonated water, and plain water.

Truck drivers can enjoy certain beverages in moderation. These beverages include juice, smoothies, and sports drinks.

Most truck drivers can't live without coffee. However, if their coffee intake affects their sleep, they may need to cut back. Besides large amounts of coffee, other beverages to avoid on the road include soda, energy drinks, instant cappuccino, and alcohol.
<ol start=""4"">
 	<li>
<h2><strong> Get Enough Sleep</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
Truck drivers are notorious for not getting enough sleep. However, besides helping them do their job better, sleep can also improve their health. Many truck drivers already struggle with hypertension. When hypertension is combined with a poor night of sleep, truck drivers can experience high blood pressure the next day.

Other health issues that are common for those who don't get enough sleep include:
<ul>
 	<li>Mood disorders, such as anxiety and depression</li>
 	<li>Weakened immune system</li>
 	<li>Increased appetite</li>
 	<li>Chronic fatigue syndrome</li>
 	<li>Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism</li>
 	<li>Obstructive sleep apnea</li>
</ul>
Because sleep plays such a large role in the life of a truck driver, they should do everything they can to get enough sleep. Most people need at least eight hours, but this varies from person to person.

For truck drivers who want to sleep better while on the road, they can try some things. Truckers should keep their sleep schedule as regular as possible, which means going to sleep and waking up at the same time every day.

They should also park their truck in a quiet and safe spot, use truck window shades or a mask to block out light, put on some white noise or wear earplugs to drown out sound, and keep the cab at a comfortable temperature.
<ol start=""5"">
 	<li>
<h2><strong> Get Up and Move</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
Truck drivers sit for many hours at a time. All that sitting is not good for their bodies. When truck drivers have downtime while on the road, they should get up and move their bodies. Some ways to do this including hitting the local gym, taking a long walk, jump roping, or doing some stretches.

While many truck drivers these days still enjoy using a CB radio, many of them have found that cell phones offer a convenient way to communicate with other truckers as well as those back home. Besides communication, another benefit cell phones provide are the many apps that truck drivers can download.

<!--more-->

Learn about five useful apps for truck drivers.
<ol>
 	<li>
<h2><strong> Truck and Travel</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
The Truck and Travel app is especially helpful for truck drivers who travel long distances from time to time. The app puts a lot of helpful information right at a truck driver's fingertips. For instance, when truck drivers are on the road, they need to know where the nearest truck stop is in case they need to fuel up, eat, or get some rest.

The app contains a filter that allows truck drivers to see what amenities each truck stop has to offer, such as showers, laundry facilities, ATMs, check cashing, internet, and service bays. The Truck and Travel app also lets truck drivers know the nearest rest areas, weigh stations, truck ramps, truck washes, truck dealers, and chain motels that advertise truck parking.
<ol start=""2"">
 	<li>
<h2><strong> Drivewyze</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
Truck drivers are used to stopping at any and all weigh stations as they drive from one location to the next. Making these stops not only wastes fuel but can be a time waster as well, especially when truck drivers have to wait in line.

The good news is that an app called Drivewyze lets truck drivers legally bypass weigh stations at over 800 sites and in 47 participating states and provinces. Truck drivers with a high carrier safety score will be more likely to bypass weigh stations and inspection sites.

The app also lets truck drivers know what weigh stations and inspections sites are coming up ahead. Truck drivers can take advantage of the app's free trial offer. Once the free trial ends, truck drivers will need to pay a monthly subscription.
<ol start=""3"">
 	<li>
<h2><strong> The Weather Channel</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
Truck drivers always need to be aware of the weather. If a truck driver knows bad weather is going to hit, they can make plans to either take a different route or find a place to safely pull off the road and wait it out. In order to stay up to date on changing weather, truck drivers should download a weather app, such as The Weather Channel.

This app provides the following weather information:
<ul>
 	<li>Temperature</li>
 	<li>Humidity</li>
 	<li>Wind speed</li>
 	<li>UV index</li>
 	<li>Sunrise and sunset</li>
 	<li>Visibility</li>
</ul>
Truck drivers have a choice to get updated information on an hourly, 36-hour, or 10-day basis. Truck drivers will also be able to see the latest Doppler radar so they will know if they are driving into or away from a weather event. Users can also choose to receive notifications of severe weather, including storms, tornadoes, and blizzards.

Besides The Weather Channel, other weather apps truck drivers might find useful include Intellicast HD, Storm Shield, and Weather Underground.
<ol start=""4"">
 	<li>
<h2><strong> Waze</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
Many truck drivers use GPS to help them navigate from one location to another without getting lost. However, it can also be helpful for truck drivers to have more information, such unusually heavy traffic or road closures.

Waze is one app that uses a truck driver's current location to let them know more about live traffic events and other road hazards. The app even lets truck drivers know about gas prices in the area. For truck drivers who drive through large cities on a regular basis, Waze is one app that can be very useful.
<ol start=""5"">
 	<li>
<h2><strong> Lose It!</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
It can be easy for truck drivers to get into the habit of eating fast food or food from a truck stop, which usually aren't very healthy options. For truck drivers who are concerned about the food they eat and want to make healthier choices while on the road, several apps can help them do just that. One such app is called Lose It!

This app helps truck drivers set daily caloric intake goals and track the number of calories they consume. The app also contains a graph to track weight loss, plus it motivates truck drivers to lose weight by letting them know they have hit certain milestones.

A few more features of the Lose It! app include:
<ul>
 	<li>Nutrition information about various foods</li>
 	<li>Water intake tracking to ensure adequate amounts are consumed</li>
 	<li>Goal setting regarding carb, protein, and macronutrient intake</li>
</ul>
The app can also produce and send reports on eating behaviors and progress as well as scan food package barcodes for information and tracking purposes.

Cell phones, along with the many available apps, make communication and navigation much easier for truck drivers.

"Better Sleep in a Long-Haul Sleeper Semi | Arrow Truck Sales","Whether you're looking for a new semi-truck or need to change your habits, follow these tips to dramatically change your sleep schedule for the better.",90,,,,,,,,Uncategorized,,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/truck.jpg,truck.jpg,"E:\Sites\arrowtruck_com\blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/truck.jpg",787,"18 Wheel Truck on the road during the day.

Front View",,"long-haul sleep truck",http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/truck.jpg,,,,,,,,,786,"When you're on a long trucking journey, you must take the time to park, snooze, and get fully rested for extended driving on the road. As you plan your next big trucking trip, consider some tips to sleep better.

Whether you're looking for a new semi-truck or need to change your habits, these tips can dramatically change your sleep schedule for the better.
<h2>1. Seek Out Sleeper Cab Features</h2>
A long-haul sleeper semi is built for sleeping on the road and becomes an essential part of cross-country trips. When you're shopping for a truck, be on the lookout for a few key details. The first is the length of the bed. If you are a tall person, you do not want to cram your body into a small space.

Your legs will ache, you will not get the best rest, and it could negatively impact your whole trip. Find a sleeper cab with emphasis on the width and length of a bed so you can fit comfortably and sleep well.

You should also consider a sleeper cab with a permanent bed. Some cabs have conversion beds where a table transitions into a bed, but when you are ready to go to sleep, you do not want to constantly worry about transitioning the bed space. The base of a permanent bed will also provide more stability and comfort.

If you drive on your own, you may still consider a sleep cab with bunk beds. A flip down top bunk wouldn't be an ideal option for sleeping but does provide plenty of extra storage. You can keep bags, clothes, and other items on the top bunk while the bottom bed remains open. When you're ready to sleep, you can go to bed without delays.
<h2>2. Purchase a Mattress</h2>
The standard mattresses found in sleeper cabs are often pretty basic designs. Thankfully, many companies offer mattresses made for sleeper cabs. A lot of sizes are comparable to RV mattresses, but you should check the specific dimensions inside your truck before making a purchase.

A thicker mattress will provide more support and comfort. When you have something comfortable to sleep on, you will not have aches and pains from a bad night of sleep. You will drive more comfortably and not have to worry about leg cramps or neck pain.
<h2>3. Block Out Light</h2>
The driving schedule you follow could lead to different sleep times. In some cases, you may have to sleep during the days or in the afternoons before the sun sets. Use shades and light blockers to help keep all the natural light out of a sleeper cab. Even at night, street lights and head lights can create distractions as you try to sleep.

Some semi-trucks may have shades built in that you can shut when you're ready to rest. Otherwise, you have the option to hang blackout curtains. Blackout curtains are designed to block out natural light and will provide a dark sleeping area. Our bodies react when exposed to natural light. The exposure will directly impact the circadian rhythm and could result in poor sleep.

Along with blocking out the main source of light from your truck cab, consider covering up small windows with curtains as well.
<h2>4. Manage Noise Control</h2>
Along with light, another impact on your sleep is excessive noise. At a rest stop alone, you will hear the highway traffic, other trucks starting up, and a random horn or two. Use noise control to help you sleep better and avoid the distractions. If you are constantly woken up while you sleep, you could suffer and feel more tired as you drive.

A battery-powered noise machine can help drown out other noise. For example, you can use white noise or a natural sound like rainfall. When you do use a noise machine, just ensure that your alarm is set at a louder volume so you can still wake up at the time you need to.
<h2>5. Use Climate Control Systems</h2>
On the extreme end of weather, you can have restless sleep if your cab is too hot or too cold. A proper climate management system will ensure you stay comfortable while on the road. For cold weather, you can not only have heat, but you can also pack a few extra blankets along for the trip.

On hot nights, you can rely on an air conditioner to cool the cab down and provide extra comfort. An auxiliary power unit built into the sleeper cab will typically provide you with the air conditioning so you do not need to run the air from the main engine of the truck.

By having both cooling and heating options, you can find the most comfortable settings for your sleep needs.

"Truck Driver Security | Arrow Truck Sales","Every job comes with its own occupational hazards, and truck driving is no different. Learn here about some common security concerns and precautions.",30,,,,,,,,Uncategorized,,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/featured-image.jpg,featured-image.jpg,"E:\Sites\arrowtruck_com\blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/featured-image.jpg",791,"semi truck",,,,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/featured-image.jpg,,,,,,,,,790,"Every job comes with its own occupational hazards, and truck driving is no different. For instance, truck malfunctions can pose a health and safety risk. And just like a homeowner, a truck driver also has to take security precautions against vandalism, robbery, and similar criminal events.

Here are some of the basics of security concerns and precautions for truck drivers.
<h2>Why You Should Take Notice</h2>
Truck driving means that you'll be isolated a lot of the time, and your truck will often be carrying valuable cargo. This can make criminals such as robbers consider you a worthwhile target. If thieves come after your cargo, you could sustain injuries in addition to suffering the financial loss of being robbed.
<h2>What Tools Can Help Improve Security</h2>
Improving your security on the road starts with awareness. According to the FBI, cargo theft incidents may cost up to a total of <a href=""https://www.overdriveonline.com/partner-solutions-article/haulhound/highway-robbery/"">30 billion</a> dollars annually. Awareness of how cargo thieves and robbers operate can help you to keep your eyes open for any fishy scenarios and inform you of what to guard against.

Some tools to help you improve security include monitoring tools, locking tools, planning tools, and emergency tools. For example, GPS tracking is a monitoring tool that can help keep track of your truck at all times. It can be invaluable if your truck is ever stolen. You can also have GPS installed separately on the trailer of your truck in case thieves take just the trailer.

Other tools that can improve overall security include:
<ul>
 	<li>Camera systems that can catch video footage of traffic incidents or robbery, which could help apprehend criminals</li>
 	<li>Apps that provide community feedback on truck stops and parking locations, so you can choose the safest places to stop</li>
 	<li>Alarm systems for semitrucks that can provide sirens, panic buttons, starter kill switches, and other tools to fight truck theft</li>
</ul>
Combining several of these tools can provide a lot more options to not only prevent thefts but also help catch thieves if they do target your truck.
<h2>Which Precautions and Habits Can Thwart Criminals</h2>
Simple security precautions can help you avoid potentially dangerous situations and keep your truck from looking like easy pickings. In addition to using tools to enhance security, you can improve your situational awareness and establish habits that will help protect your truck from criminals.

Some examples of precautions and habits to use include:
<ul>
 	<li>Choosing only truck stops with a good reputation</li>
 	<li>Locking up securely every time you step out of the cab (including when you refuel)</li>
 	<li>Carrying plenty of insurance on your load</li>
 	<li>Parking your truck tail to tail with another truck so thieves can't open the doors</li>
</ul>
Tandem driving may also help reduce vulnerabilities. When you have a second driver along, one of you can stay with the load at all times and thus avoid situations where your truck is unattended. In addition, you'll be less isolated if you tandem drive.
<h2>Why Being Prepared for Emergency Situations Is Important</h2>
Your vehicle could be an easy target for cargo robbery if you end up stranded in an isolated location. Staying on top of emergency preparedness can help you avoid being stranded alone on the side of the road for long stretches of time.

The better prepared you are with tools and equipment, plus knowledge and technique to help you quickly get back on the road, the less likely you are to present an obvious target. So keep your toolbox well-stocked at all times in case your truck ever needs minor repairs, and make sure you have contact information ready for a reliable truck recovery company.

You should also be prepared for situations where someone else asks for emergency help. Never leave your truck to help someone out, since it could be a trap to lure you away from your cargo. Instead, offer to call 911 or a roadside assistance company. Criminals sometimes pose as stranded drivers in order to scam or even rob other drivers on the road.
<h2>What to Do if You Experience a Theft</h2>
Security advice often focuses solely on how to avoid being targeted for criminal activity. However, you should also prepare for the (hopefully very small) possibility of actually undergoing a robbery. If someone actually does target you and steal some of your cargo, your first priority should be personal safety: don't do anything that would put you at risk of bodily harm.

However, if you ever do find yourself in this situation, there are several things you can do that could help bring the criminals to justice later. For example:
<ul>
 	<li>Watch and listen carefully so you can give the police a helpful statement later</li>
 	<li>If the criminals have a vehicle, check for a license plate number</li>
 	<li>Call 911 first, even before calling your dispatcher, as soon as the criminals leave</li>
</ul>
While truck driving will always come with some security risks, these steps can help you to bypass or minimize many of them, providing better protection for yourself and your truck.

When you are not driving, you can rely on an unlimited mobile internet plan to talk to others through video chat. A cell phone or laptop with a webcam will provide direct connections to family members and friends.

Seeing the familiar faces and making social connections can help you feel better while on the road. You have multiple options for unlimited internet connections. For example, you can purchase a mobile hotspot connection that gives you unlimited internet data and can pair with devices like laptops or tablets.

If you frequently drive in areas with poor internet connections, then you can consider satellite internet for a truck. The satellite connection may offer more stable options as you travel near places without cell towers.
<h2>2. Rest Stop Options</h2>
When planning out your rest stops for your trip, some rest stop areas are a lot different than others. Smaller rest stops may only include a convenience store and bathrooms, while others feel like mini-malls. Seek out larger rest stops on the road, which may give you a chance to hang out away from your truck and socialize with others for an extended amount of time.

Even if you just sit at a table to enjoy a meal, you may meet other truck drivers who are at the same rest stop. The interaction outside of your truck can help quell loneliness and give you a little extra interaction before heading out on the road again.

As you find rest stops you enjoy, keep track of their location so you can revisit the locations in the future. As you plan trips early on, you may find some hit-or-miss rest stops, but the learning curve will ensure you have the best locations in the future.
<h2>3. Healthy Eating Options</h2>
If you feel lonely, you could make your symptoms worse with the consumption of junk food. A behavior known as <strong><a href=""https://www.technology.org/2019/04/28/why-people-eat-junk-food-when-theyre-sad-or-lonely/"">hedonic consumption</a></strong> occurs when people seek out quick and fast junk food options to provide comfort for sad or lonely feelings. While the tastes may seem satisfying at first, you may end up feeling more sad or lonely.

Before a trucking trip even begins, make an effort to eat healthy and keep your body feeling good. Consider packing fruits and vegetables to consume as small snacks. Consider a truck cab with a mini-fridge. The refrigerator can hold healthy foods and keep the foods for the duration of the trip.

When you stop off at rest stops, look for healthier food options besides fast-food restaurants. If you are limited to quick eating options, look for some of their healthy menu choices like salads or grilled chicken.

When consuming drinks on the road, you should also consider simple and healthy options like water. Sugary drinks like soda or flavored fruit juices could have the same effect as junk food.
<h2>4. Ride Along Options</h2>
One of the most effective ways to reduce loneliness on the road is to have someone with you. However, there are specific rules for the road for a driving companion.

Many driving companies require written requests and formal permission to bring a passenger with you on the road. The passenger is typically limited to a married spouse and may not include a companion or long-term partner if you are not married.

If you have children, older kids may receive permission to ride along with you. In some cases, the child has to be at least <strong><a href=""https://www.truckdriveracademy.com/can-truck-drivers-carry-passengers/"">10 years old</a></strong>. No matter who rides along with you, no driving is allowed and you may have to pay extra insurance costs to cover the extra passenger.

The extra effort may take a little time to complete but could be one of the best ways to impact your loneliness on the road. You will have someone by your side for the duration of the trip and could turn a ride along option into a regular thing as you travel across the country.

As you plan out your days on the road, consider the used truck options we have at<strong> <a href=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/"">Arrow Truck Sales</a></strong>. We will help you pick a truck with extra features to help reduce loneliness while you drive.

Whether it was helping re-stock shelves across the country with toilet paper or supplying COVID-19 vaccines, the efforts of the most thankless job in America are being properly recognized. In difficult economic times, the trucking industry has actually helped keep some businesses afloat. Without truckers, times could be even more drastic. As long as there’s truck drivers on the road – we have a fighting chance as a country.

With every negative that happens there’s a positive. In the trucking industry, we’ve seen a group of hard working people get more recognition than they’ve received historically – and it’s so well deserved. Truck drivers have been an essential part of our country since trucks were invented – and now their efforts have been more appropriately brought to light.

In the midst of a devastating crisis in our country – opportunity arose for truckers to step up across America. They more than delivered. We relied on the trucking industry before the pandemic – we rely on it even more now. The efforts even earned presidential praise in early April 2020 at the start of the pandemic. Truck drivers been a critical pieces of our response to crisis – and the value of the men and women working hard to keep America moving are getting their recognition.

If you bought it, a truck driver brought it.

,,30,18,,,,,,,"Successful Driver",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,803,"On the second episode of the Successful Driver podcast we talked with Nick Lombardo of Arrow's purchasing and wholesale team. We asked him based on all the interactions he's had with successful drivers, what he thought led to their business success?

He spoke about a flatbed trailer driver and how he approached his business. 

""I'll never forget Sammy Silvers. He came rolling in a 1980-something Kenworth K-100 cabover. He owned the truck, had it paid off, had his own flatbed trailer. Sammy was always looking not for the next load, but the load after that. He looked at it from a business standpoint. In the flatbed business he figured out that he could haul steel into Kansas City - and when he came into town he could put wooden spools from the electric company, put them on the steel and drop them off on the way to his next load. Drivers that think like that - looking to maximize their load and earning potential. The drivers looking to reduce their cost - the ones that know how much their truck was making them or the company - were finding success. I thought before I got in a truck industry the decision making behind buying a commercial truck would be more about business practices.""

Lombardo says sometimes there is more preference in the truck than there is about the business side of owning. 

""When I got in I was surprised there was a lot more personal preference. You're going to live in that truck a week at a time. There has to be some personal preferences met. Your main focus has to be on the business side or else you're not going to make it. Those guys that taught me about how they were successful - approaching their business from a mindset. I think everyone in the business works hard - you can't drive a truck without working hard. Especially some aspects of the industry - flatbed drivers. They're climbing up and down, they're strapping and tarping. The ones that could still approach it with a business mindset were the ones that found success. What they know, what they're willing to learn, but already know enough business-wise to set themselves up in the right direction."" 

Being creative and mindful of ways to maximize your load is certainly a pattern followed by successful drivers - not just in the flatbed aspect of the industry but in every element.

The trucking industry is no different and it manifests itself in a variety of ways.



With trucks themselves, there has been a learning curve with emissions technology throughout the last twenty years - for everyone. Some manufacturers have experienced growing pains trying to perfect the technology required to help the trucking industry do their part in promoting a cleaner environment. Safety and aerodynamics have seen major strides in the last decade. Fleets, suppliers, leasing companies and drivers have had to constantly learn the nuances of trucks with emerging technology. The byproduct of all these changes and learning across the board has brought the quality of units to newer heights. 

The trucking industry is a well educated industry - livelihood depends on knowing the ins and outs of your unit. The rise of social media has helped keep truck drivers connected to each other - and allowed for wisdom to be imparted on newer generations of truck drivers. Media specific to educating the truck market is available with video accessibility made easy on the likes of Facebook, Youtube, Instagram, and more. There are several options to help you gain knowledge and understanding of the hot button issues on the road. 

The way trucks are advertised, bought and sold has changed significantly as well. Gone are the days where salesman would have to mail photos of a unit to a customer. Print media has changed significantly - with every major publication also having a digital wing to get maximum exposure. Information on trucks is now more accessible than it has ever been. Between the information available online from an education standpoint, truck data is more prominently displayed to help potential buyers enter a negotiation on a unit with confidence.

Though it hasn't always been perfect, the resiliency of the trucking industry has shown itself in how it has adapted and grown over the last few decades. It will be ready for whatever significant technological disruptors come next.

Not only do you drive in hazardous weather conditions like snow and ice, but you constantly deal with cold weather. A truck can only provide so much heat and comfort while on the open road.

<!--more-->

If you want to remain comfortable while out on the road, then consider this collection of tips to help you through the process. Once you master the tips, you can enjoy each winter without cold weather becoming a major issue while you drive.
<h2>1. Use Hot Cup Warmers</h2>
Enjoying beverages like coffee or tea can help you get through long drives on the road, but winter weather can cause the drinks to lose their warmth quickly. Help keep your drinks warm with a hot cup warmer. While an insulated beverage container also helps trap in heat, you may not always bring your own beverages or have the means to use the cups.

As you stop off at rest stops, you may pick up a drink in a disposable cup. The quick drink options are ideal for a hot cup warmer. The drink will remain warm for an extended amount of time and help heat up your body with each sip you have.

A hot cup warmer will typically plug into a truck's power outlet or USB outlet that’s in the dashboard. A hot cup warmer will fit inside most cup holders and can remain there so you don't have to take it out each time or waste storage space. If you have cold drinks, you can simply leave the power off the device, and the cup holder acts as insulation for the cold beverage.
<h2>2. Shop for Winter Camping Gear</h2>
If warmth is your objective, then shop for items geared towards cold weather. People who camp in the winter usually seek out the warmest gear, and you can take advantage of this gear for your truck driving. For example, if your truck has a sleeper cab, then you may consider a winter camping sleeping bag.

Even with an auxiliary power unit to keep warm, a winter sleeping bag can provide comfort and total body warmth for nights where you utilize the sleeper cab. While driving, you may consider a layered jacket that provides flexibility and warmth.

Many camping jackets are designed for active hiking movements, which will still give you easy ways to move around while you drive and operate a truck.
<h2>3. Purchase Rechargeable Warmers</h2>
Hand and foot warmers have been used for years to boost the warmth inside gloves or boots. Former warmers used to be disposable and only lasted for a few hours. As a trucker, you can purchase rechargeable warmers for on the road. If you have to pump gas or work on exterior elements of a truck, the warmers provide extra comfort.

You can easily slip a warmer into your pocket or the side of a boot. Modern technology makes the little devices easy to charge so you can always have access while out on the road. Many of the devices are sold in sets, or you can purchase warmers individually and based on your personal needs.
<h2>4. Install a Microwave</h2>
During the winter, warm foods like soup provide comfort and will help keep the chills away. If you purchase a truck with a sleeper cab, then you can look into adding a microwave. A microwave provides a quick way to warm up food and enjoy hot meals on the go. A small microwave is all you need for the road, especially for a single driver.

When you park for overnight rest, a microwave is ideal for dinner. You can also use a microwave for extra warmth options. For example, you could heat up a therapy neck wrap in the microwave. The neck wrap provides extra warmth as you lay down and go to sleep for the night.

The warmth can also help relax muscles reduce any sores or pains you have from extended driving time on the road.
<h2>5. Indoor Dining Options</h2>
As you plan out your truck driving route in the winter, consider rest stops with indoor dining options. Locations with tables and booths give you the option to sit and relax without wasting gas or power in your truck. The rest stops provide warmth and are often well-heated during the winter.

Not only can you enjoy the heat, but you can enjoy a hot meal as well. Visit rest stops you know have indoor locations or communicate with other truck drivers to find out about the best stops to visit.

When you're looking to sign on with a fleet, one of the first things to be considered when making such a decision must be safety. There are clearly a lot of valuable factors that play into your choice of who to work with, but it's a red flag if the priority of the fleet isn't on the safety and well being of a driver and those out on the road with them.

""Safety is our highest calling. There's nothing more important than safety in our company,"" Wilson Logistics President Darrel Wilson told us. ""Everyone knows that we have to operate safe. If our drivers are out on the road and they tell us something is unsafe, it's unsafe.""

Being able to be part of a culture that invites concerns on the road to be communicated is a valuable piece of a driver-fleet relationship that goes beyond simply the safety aspect. It's a reflection of the entirety of the culture of the company if you are able to raise concerns. 

Safety is baked into becoming a successful driver in so many ways. Be it equipment selection, equipment knowledge, driver health, compliance, so many elements of driver success have safety at the root of it. 

We spoke with Wilson Logistics about safety and more in the latest episode of the Successful Drive Podcast.

If you experience frequent or chronic drivers fatigue, then you can help conquer this problem by changing just a few of your daily habits. <!--more-->

Read on to learn five tips for battling chronic drivers fatigue so you can keep yourself and others safer on the road.
<h2>1. Get Plenty of Restful Sleep</h2>
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that a lack of sleep contributes to about 30 to 40 percent of all highway automobile accidents. For this reason, the most important way to combat drivers fatigue is to get plenty of restful sleep between shifts on the road.

While the average trucker sleeps about 5 hours each night, you should aim to sleep about 7 to 9 hours every night to feel fully alert during your next driving shift. If you find that you cannot sleep this long in one stretch, then take naps when possible to increase the total amount of sleep you obtain during a 24-hour time frame.

If you already obtain plenty of sleep, yet still frequently feel tired behind the wheel, then you should ask your doctor to perform a sleep test to determine if you suffer from a sleep disorder that leads to less restful sleep.

One common sleep disorder that can lead to daytime sleepiness is called sleep apnea. A person suffering from this disorder repeatedly stops and starts breathing again while sleeping, which leads to less restful sleep. Treatment of this disorder typically consists of wearing a simple device at night called a CPAP machine that improves nighttime breathing to minimize sleep disruptions.
<h2>2. Drink More Water</h2>
Many long-haul truck drivers drink less water than they should to help prevent the need for frequent stops at highway rest stations, while others drink only coffee and other highly caffeinated beverages instead of water.

However, the mild dehydration that results from a lack of water consumption can lead to an increase in drowsiness, muscle cramps, and even headaches, along with a feeling of overall fatigue.

To combat dehydration, drink six to eight glasses of water every day. If you find yourself stopping at highway rest stations too often when drinking plenty of water, then consider keeping a portable trucker's urinal in your truck to reduce your number of stops.
<h2>3. Begin Exercising</h2>
Many long-haul truckers do not exercise as much as the they should. However, exercise is not only important for long-term physical health, but it can also increase alertness while driving. Exercise increases blood flow to the brain and activates a brain region called the hippocampus to help improve cognitive function. In addition, regular exercise may help to combat depression that can contribute to fatigue.

While getting exercise when on the road can be tough, remember that any physical movement you work into your day is better than none. Consider taking a walk or jog in the morning before beginning your work day, engaging in a stretching routine one or twice a day, or even performing a few jumping jacks before each meal.
<h2>4. Try These Alertness Tricks</h2>
Even if you take every step you can to ward off drivers fatigue, you may occasionally find that your alertness level drops due to simple boredom or other problems that you cannot remedy with a nap. Before you grab an extra cup of coffee, try these alertness boosting tricks:
<ul>
 	<li><em>Cool down your cab</em>. Some drivers feel more alert when the air in their cab is cool.</li>
 	<li><em>Open a window</em>. Others find that a burst of fresh air helps reduce fatigue.</li>
 	<li><em>Pop a peppermint candy.</em> <strong><a href=""http://civiceducation.clevelandclinic.org/Images/Student-Projects/2018-Fact-or-Fiction/Do-Peppermint-Candies-Help-You-Focus-Callie-Tr-(1).aspx"">Studies</a> </strong>show that the taste and smell of peppermint can help boost alertness levels.</li>
</ul>
Also look for fatigue-fighting solutions that are unique to you. For example, listening to an old favorite upbeat song or looking at a favorite family photo may help boost your mood to increase alertness.
<h2>5. Wear a Fatigue-Fighting Bracelet</h2>
If you suffer from frequent drowsiness while driving, then you may want to begin wearing a special bracelet designed for drivers like you. These bracelets all vary in design, but a popular version constantly monitors your body for physical signs of drowsiness, such as a change in heart rate, and then vibrates to signal you to pull off of the road to take a nap or take another step to increase your alertness.

Some bracelets even deliver mild, harmless electrical jolts to arouse you if the monitors sense you are on the brink of falling asleep and need awakened in a flash.

The trucking industry is flying (...or is it driving?) high right now and drivers across the country are finding phenomenal success. Rates are high and times are busy as the trucking industry helps push the country out of the final stages of a global pandemic.

We're in good days right now, but what should truck drivers do to prepare for the next dip in the market? What should they do to prepare for leaner times? Start preparing now.

""I think of stories of the ants saving up for a dry season and hoarding their harvest undergroud so that they can eat long term. We're no different,"" ATBS President and CEO Todd Amen told us on the Successful Driver Podcast. ""It's a good time, but don't and buy new toys like a Harley or bass boat, or a bunch of chrome for your truck. Save that money, because tough times will come and you're going to need it to get through tough times. It's nice to make money, it's nice to have nice things but make sure you're building your savings for when a tough time comes.""

People respond differently to the adversity that will inevitably hit when more difficult times for truck drivers come to fruition. Sometimes drivers make big decisions about equipment when times are tough. ""People react differently,"" said Amen. ""A lot of times people freak out because what's been going for a year or two isn't there anymore. So they change segments of the market. Maybe going from dry van to flatbed, or flat bed to reefer. And that's expensive. It's hard to change.""

Amen says that will changing market segments isn't always a bad thing, coming up with a long term plan for your business is essential. ""You can change over time but when you change it costs money. You have to learn a whole new segment, learn new routes.""

Identifying a segment and become an expert driver in that space can go a long way toward short and long term success, and help you survive market dips.  ""Be consistent in what you're doing. Pick something to be successful at,"" said Amen. ""Know it. Understand it. And ride out the storms, because the market will get good again. But we will have dips, there's no doubt.""

Also look for fatigue-fighting solutions that are unique to you. For example, listening to an old favorite upbeat song or looking at a favorite family photo may help boost your mood to increase alertness.
<h2>5. Wear a Fatigue-Fighting Bracelet</h2>
If you suffer from frequent drowsiness while driving, then you may want to begin wearing a special bracelet designed for drivers like you. These bracelets all vary in design, but a popular version constantly monitors your body for physical signs of drowsiness, such as a change in heart rate, and then vibrates to signal you to pull off of the road to take a nap or take another step to increase your alertness.

Some bracelets even deliver mild, harmless electrical jolts to arouse you if the monitors sense you are on the brink of falling asleep and need awakened in a flash.

Drivers fatigue is extremely common in the trucking industry. Follow these five tips to combat this fatigue and increase alertness when on the road to help prevent the auto accidents that drivers fatigue can contribute to.

Arrow Truck Sales adopted the motto ""Clear. Simple. Used Truck Buying."" in the last few years to emphasize what we believe is the core value of a successful used truck sales company.<!--more-->

What does that mean? Former President of Arrow Truck Sales and Regional Vice President at Mack Trucks Jeff Oldham helped establish the new identity at Arrow. He spoke with us on the Successful Driver Podcast about what that phrase means to him.

""I think ultimately comes down to being customer centric. They should know what they're buying. And the ultimately have a choice in what, where, why and how they buy,"" said Oldham. ""I came from the tractor industry. (In the past) You bought a tractor by going to the dealer and that's your only choice. What's happening now is customers have a choice. And at the same time, customers have access to a massive amount of data.""

Arrow's initiatives are built around not hiding from information. ""Organizationally it's our responsibility to make sure that 'Clear. Simple. Used Truck Buying.' means a truck may have a dig, may have a dent, may have a scratch,"" said Oldham. ""Let's not hide from that. Let's make sure we truly represent the way it is and meet the customers needs. Let's be upfront and transparent.""

The long term benefit to Arrow's relationship with customers is hopefully earned trust and business in the future. ""We can hide from something and push a deal out, but that deal will haunt us forever,"" said Oldham. ""It's not our opportunity to sell one truck. How does one deal turn into the next one?""

The motto means something a little different to everyone, as we'll see in future episodes with Arrow employees. Oldham cut to the core, though. We are taking the side of the customer, so that the customer wants to come back and work with us again.

"Summer Truck Driving Hazards | Arrow Truck Sales","Driving in the summer can be hazardous, and truck driving is even more so. Learn how to protect yourself and others on the road this summer.",90,17,,,,,,,"Drivers Safety",,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/oversized-load.jpg,oversized-load.jpg,"E:\Sites\arrowtruck_com\blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/oversized-load.jpg",835,"oversized load",,,,,,,,,,,,,833,"<img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-835"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/oversized-load-300x201.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""201"" />During the summer, the sun shines down and outdoor temperatures rise. In addition, traffic and construction on highways and interstates often increase. You should learn how to manage these and other summer hazards of truck driving to stay safe while on the road and help keep others on the road safe as well.<!--more-->

Read on to learn about four summer truck driving hazards and how you can manage them.
<h2>1. Excessive Sun Exposure</h2>
Many truck drivers believe the misconception that truck windows block most of the sun's harmful UV rays. However, the truth is that while most windshields do block about 96 percent of the sun's UV rays, side windows only block about <a href=""https://www.omnitracs.com/blog/3-things-truckers-should-keep-mind-about-skin-health"">44 percent</a> of them. For this reason, truck drivers need to protect their skin from the sun's cancer-causing rays even when they are inside of their truck cabs.

The easiest way to protect your skin from the sun when inside of your cab is to cover your skin with sunscreen that has an SPF of between 15 and 50 before beginning your shift on the road. Then, reapply this sun protection every two hours when you have a break in your driving.

Since the left side of your body is closer to your cab side windows than your right side when in the driver's seat of a truck, take extra care when applying sunscreen to the left side of your face and body. An estimated 75 percent of all melanoma skin cancer cases begin with a lesion detected on the left side of the body, which may be due to the extra UV ray exposure this side of the body obtains while driving.
<h2>2. Sun Glare</h2>
Another hazard of summertime driving is sun glare. While this problem can occur anytime during the day when the sun is shining, it is often the worst just after sunrise and before sunset. This glare can make it difficult to see the road, road signs, and any road obstructions present properly.

Positioning your truck's sun visors to block the sun's direct light and wearing a good pair of polarized sunglasses can help reduce the vision obstruction often caused by glare.

However, you should also keep your windshield extremely clean and crack-free to aid in driving when the sun is shining directly at your windshield; windshield cracks and debris can further scatter sunlight, which worsens the toll sun glare takes on your vision. Also, remove all items that reflect light from your dashboard when experiencing sun glare because the light that bounces off of them can further obstruct your vision.
<h2>3. Motorcycles on the Road</h2>
As the outdoor weather warms up, more people begin taking their motorcycles out on the roads. The number of registered motorcycles and motorcyclists has <a href=""https://www.travelers.com/resources/business-topics/transportation/driver-fleet-safety/4-summer-driving-hazards-to-be-aware-of"">increased</a> dramatically in recent years, which makes it more important than ever to learn how to drive safely when near these vehicles.

First, never follow too closely behind a motorcycle. You should leave about twice as much distance between this vehicle type and your truck as you would between your truck and a car. Motorcycles can stop much more quickly than cars can, and their brake lights are typically not as visible as the brake lights of a car. Both factors make it much easier to accidentally collide with a motorcycle when following too close behind them.

Also, check your blind spots on a regular basis when driving during the summer to check for motorcycles, especially when approaching lane changes and turns. These small vehicles can disappear into blind spots much more easily than cars can.

Finally, be aware that a large number of fatal auto accidents involving motorcycles occur when a car or truck driver is turning left as a motorcycle is attempting to drive straight. Be extra cautious when making left turns to help prevent this type of collision.
<h2>4. Road Construction</h2>
The summer is prime time for road construction, and driving through these work zones comes with many potential hazards. In fact, according to the Federal Highway Administration, a construction work zone accident involving a large truck occurs about once every three days in the United States. In addition, about 49 percent of fatal construction zone accidents on rural interstates occur when a truck driver collides with an object or person in the work zone.

To minimize the chance of being involved in a work zone accident this summer, always obey work limit speed signs and pay close attention to the road while driving through these zones to identify road obstructions before you hit them. In addition, when a lane change is required in approaching a work zone, merge slowly and carefully while paying close attention to your blind spots during the merge.

Finally, continue to keep the proper distance between your truck and the vehicle ahead of you when in the work zone, as many drivers naturally forget to do when driving through these construction areas.

Keep these potential summertime hazards of truck driving and the steps you can take to manage them in mind as the weather warms up to stay safer while on the road all season long.  Contact the truck experts at Arrow Truck Sales for all of your <a href=""https://www.arrowtruck.com/docs/index.aspx"">quality used truck</a> needs today.",,"1970-01-01 00:00:00",post,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/?p=833,draft,1,ATSBlogM,schaiyote@arrowtruck.com,,,4-summer-truck-driving-hazards-manage,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-04-20 15:31:26"
,,30,1,,,,,,,"Successful Driver|Uncategorized",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,839,"Arrow Truck Sales - Philadelphia's Finance and Insurance Manager Carrie Shingleton has never been a truck driver. She will be the first to tell you that. However, in her role at Arrow she works daily with owner-operators to help them set up their business for success in their most recent purchase with the company. She sees a lot of different of people from a variety of backgrounds - representing a variety of industries in trucking. Here are some of the key things she thinks are important for successful drivers.

<strong>Equipment Research</strong>
""Your business is on wheels. You don't have an office. You really have to put a lot of thought into it - starting with the equipment,"" says Shingleton. ""You have to have a reliable truck. You need to think about protecting your truck. It's an investment in your business. If your truck goes down, you're not making any money.""

<strong>Budgeting</strong>
""Another big thing is budgeting. You can't have money coming in and out and not really think about where it's going. You might have your truck payment consistent but you have other stuff going in that can fluctuate depending on how much you're driving or how much diesel you're using,"" say Shingleton.

Being meticulous about the dollars and cents - even smaller expenses can go a long way. ""Even little things like eating,"" Say Shingleton. ""It sounds like nothing but just throwing money at things and not thinking about it - not having a system in place to track all of your money. You can lose out if you're not thinking about it.""

<strong>Support system</strong>
Having people with a vested interested in your success can help you achieve your goals.

""One of the under talked about aspects of being a successful driver is the importance of a support system, says Shingleton. ""Whether it's a business partner, accountant or significant other that has some system in place to ensure you are successful. Because if you're just haphazardly doing things - you could be in trouble.""

<strong>Haul source and networking</strong>
""Haul source is crucial,"" says Shingleton. ""There's a lot of people out there promising things to drivers and they don't deliver."" Reaching out to connections in the industry can help you get answers. ""You need to be networking - figuring out who has the best loads and what they're paying. If you're doing the load boards are they taking a percent of your money? You have to think things through and research them. Networking is amazing because if you talk to other people and get the truth.""

,,30,18,,,,,,,"Successful Driver",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,849,"We were lucky enough to spend some time with Stan Saunders, HVAC Product Support for Road Choice on the most recent episode of the successful driver podcast. We asked him several questions about HVAC and he provided some great answers about what truck drivers need to know about their systems. 

<strong>Heat check</strong>

The environment has been on an upward trend with regard to temperature. 

""The temperature outside has changed more so in the last few years, to where it's super hot. And I don't see that going away,"" said Saunders. 

Beyond just rising temperatures though is truck-related heat. ""The temperatures around the truck because of the EPA is getting hotter,"" said Saunders. ""We've got EGR, DPF filters. All these things generate heat that we didn't have in trucks in 2007. With the additional heat from the temperatures outside and the technology with the regulations, the temperature around the truck is hotter than it ever has.""

While the temperatures rise for various reasons, the technology for HVAC in trucks has been stead for the last 25 years. ""We've been using the same AC refrigerant for 26 years,"" Saunders said. ""The technology is there, we're doing the best we can when we're making trucks.""

If your unit isn't able to keep up even running correctly, it may be time to look for help. ""If that's not satisfactory then maybe they need to look at some auxiliary AC.""

<strong>Early indicators of issues</strong>

Truck drivers need to proactive about monitoring their HVAC. It can be an uncomfortable experience being without AC or with a failing unit for extended periods of time. 

One thing Saunders suggests is monitoring the temperature of the cab. ""I'd keep a constant eye on the temperature coming out of the outlets,"" he said. ""When a system fails, it's usually one of two ways. It fails very abruptly or it fades away. I always recommend for drivers to keep a dash outlet thermometer. What you're looking for is about a thirty degree drop from ambient temperature outside. If it's 90 degrees outside, you'd want the outlets to be at about 60. If you see that you're not getting your thirty degree drop and it's gradual, you know that your AC isn't working properly. It's going to be a matter of refrigerant or components that need to be cleaned.""

If you are starting to experience issues, it's important to get it addressed quickly. ""Non-working AC systems laying around will get more damage, more contaminants in the system if it's open for any reason and make the job more expensive to repair.""

You can find more insights from Saunders on the Successful Driver podcast.

Before your next big road trip, read this drink guide to learn about caffeine and ways to boost energy while you’re on the road.
<h2>Caffeinated Drinks and Extra Calories</h2>
As a truck driver, monitoring your caloric intake is important. When you drink caffeinated beverages, the extra calories can really sneak up on you. Cream, sugar, and toppings like whipped cream can all add calories to your daily diet. When you drink coffee, consider the use of artificial sweeteners and skim milk to reduce calories.

When you drink soda, stick to diet or zero-sugar drinks to cut out extra calories. The replacement options will not change the amount of caffeine you have. If you seek out more natural options, then consider a stevia-based drink option. Stevia is a calorie-free sweetener that is derived from plants.
<h2>Freshly Brewed Drinks</h2>
If you purchase pre-made coffee and caffeinated drinks, you will likely consume a lot of extra calories and sugar. Present your body with fresh forms of caffeine with freshly brewed drinks. Purchase a small, single-cup brewer for your truck. Before you head out on the road, brew yourself a cup of coffee or tea. The drink will taste fresh and hot.

Brewing your own coffee will save you money when compared to purchasing daily cups from rest stops and other locations. A truck with a mini-fridge is ideal for storing fresh creamer. You also have the option to bring powdered creamer with you so you do not need to rely on refrigeration.

You no longer need to worry about finding rest stops with coffee shops when you can park and make coffee at any location. For quicker stops, consider instant coffee. Instant coffee is easy to store in your truck and comes in many flavors.

The small grounds dissolve in water and transform the drink into coffee. Put the instant coffee into a bottle of water and have a go-to drink option. The taste may not live up to fresh-brewed coffee, but the main goal is to have a source of caffeine.
<h2>Bulk Purchases</h2>
Save even more money and get your caffeine fix with bulk purchases of caffeinated beverages. If you choose to brew your own drinks, then you could bulk purchase K-cups coffee pods. Many bulk purchases include all the same flavor, while others include a variety of flavors to mix it up a bit.

Also, consider making a bulk purchase of caffeinated beverages like soda. Purchase boxes of cans and bottles for your truck. Websites and wholesale retail stores offer bulk purchases. Make the purchases before big trips on the road so you have plenty in stock.

For example, you may average two to three caffeinated beverages per day. So if you have a seven-day truck trip, then you would need at least 21 cans or bottles. If bulk purchases include more, then you can save drinks for future trips. Keep track of expiration dates on the drinks so you can cycle out fresh ones for each extended trip on the road.
<h2>Energy Shots</h2>
While out on the open road, you may feel tempted to purchase energy drinks or shots. While the drinks would keep you alert on the open road, you have to consider a lot of negative side effects associated with the drinks. Energy shots may cause fast heart rates, sleep disturbances, and jitters.

Eventually, you will suffer from an energy crash from the effects of the energy shots. You know your body best, but you should try to avoid energy shots as much as possible. The negative effects often outweigh the alertness provided by the shots, and you can find better ways to stay alert and caffeinated.
<h2>Snack Boosts</h2>
When you drink caffeine, pair the drinks with healthy food options to boost your energy and feel great through long drives. Ideally, you want foods with vitamins that boost your energy. One of the best snack options is a banana. Bananas are filled with high amounts of vitamin B. Vitamin B is a natural energy booster that can help you feel alert.

Another option is dark chocolate. Chocolate has natural caffeine, and a little dark chocolate goes well with drinks like coffee and tea. You can often find bananas and dark chocolate at rest stops or pack your own inside the truck.

Taking a sick day is often out of the question because someone cannot just drive and meet up with you to take over your duties. You could have a stomach illness, a bad headache, or just a day where you feel under the weather. Preparation and prevention can help keep you healthy for the open road.

Follow this trucker's guide to learn about ways to manage illness, continue your job, and get better quickly.
<h2>Daily Preventative Help</h2>
Taking on a sickness after it sets can be difficult. If you take the time beforehand to improve your health, then you can prevent a lot of ailments in the first place. One of the first places to start is with daily vitamins. Vitamins can help boost your immune system and give your body extra energy.

Vitamin C is a natural immune boosters and provide an extra boost as your body fights off viruses. Vitamin D can help with your bone health and <strong><a href=""https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/features/vitamin-d-vital-role-in-your-health"">r</a><a href=""https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/features/vitamin-d-vital-role-in-your-health"">esearch</a><a href=""https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/features/vitamin-d-vital-role-in-your-health""> studies</a></strong> have shown that it reduces blood pressure. A doctor may do blood work to see specific vitamin levels and recommend supplements for you.

Along with taking vitamins, stay hydrated on the road. Always have fresh water available. Dehydration can lead to many health problems including muscle stiffness, fatigue, weakness, and dizziness. Also consider sports beverages, which include electrolytes and other ingredients to help keep you hydrated as you drive.

When you eat on the road, your daily choices can make a difference on your overall health. Choose clean and fresh options like fruit and vegetables. At rest stops, try to avoid fried food options. With fresh options, you can avoid stomach ailments along with other issues like heartburn.
<h2>Seasonal Health</h2>
Some health ailments only occur seasonally. Treat the issues beforehand to avoid emergency situations on the road. For example, in the spring and summer, you may suffer from allergies due to pollen and other particles in the air. A prescription for allergy medication can give you a way to deal with the onset of sneezing and congestion.

In the winter, colds and viruses tend to spread around. You could become more vulnerable as you stop at multiple businesses and rest stops. Consider getting your flu shot in the early fall to help build up antibodies and reduce the chance of virus-related illnesses.
<h2>Medical Kit</h2>
A first-aid kit is ideal for cuts and injuries, but you should prepare your own personalized health kit for the road. Stay healthy with easy access to medication like ibuprofen or a cough suppressant. Consider liquid stomach relief or pill-based stomach relief to have in case you get an upset stomach. If you frequently get heartburn, then consider heartburn medication.

You know your body well, so consider what ailments you suffer from the most and have products ready. Also consider packing options for a sleeper cab. If you drive long distance trips, you may want to consider sleep aids like an eye mask or specific scented lotions to help you sleep. A full night's rest can make a big difference in the way you feel during the day.
<h2>Health Apps</h2>
When you are not feeling well on the road, you could run into challenges as you seek medical help. Your regular doctor is often back at home. Consider other resources for quick help on the road. Many health apps allow you to look up symptoms and see what conditions you may have.

For more direct answers, consider apps that connect you to health professionals. You can often access this direct help quickly, without the need to make an appointment weeks into the future. With telehealth options, you can conduct video calls directly with nurses and doctors. You can go over your ailments and receive guidance for treatment. Video connections may also allow you to show doctors any physical symptoms you have.

In many cases, the doctors can issue prescriptions and you can find a nearby pharmacy to pick up medicine. You’ll be able to get treatment quickly instead of having to wait until you're back home again.
<h2>Driving Partners</h2>
Another way to help with illness on the road is with the use of a driving partner. When you have a co-pilot travel with you, you do not need to constantly push yourself to the limit. While one person drives, the other one can get some rest. If you feel unwell, the other person can take over driving duties while you focus on making yourself better.

If the other driver is sick, then you can focus on driving. You will not lose travel time and everyone involved can remain healthy along the way. Some trucking companies may offer extra drivers, or you can find another trucker who will travel with you.

Once you create a system that works, you can avoid illness or any of the other problems associated with being sick on the road.

Whether it's prior roles as a salesman and branch manager, or his role today, the man has done a lot of deals on used commercial vehicles.

<img src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/bc39dbeb-0a2b-45e0-8511-70564265d6be-300x200.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""200"" class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-795"" />

When it comes to resale value, Church has some suggestions on how to get the most out of your used truck.
""Whether it's a truck, a car, a bass boat, a house, people like to buy nice things,"" said Church. ""When you look at two different trucks, and they came from the same place, and two different people had control of its outcome. If one is clean, the bumper got scratched but they took care of it when they could, and the tires match.""

Beyond keeping things clean and consistent, Church also preaches proactivity. ""Making sure there's not oil leaks to the ground. If you get a simple oil leak today, just fix it. It becomes a massive leak down the road and sprays all over the truck.""

It can be tempting to collect insurance money on minor issues and not resolve issues with the truck, but Church cautions against that. ""If you get dinged. Instead of taking the insurance money and saying 'When things slow down, I'll get it fixed'. Just get it fixed."" 

Church mentions that if at all possible, resolving issues in a timely fashion is important. ""I know there are bills to pay, there is a reality to everything, but if you can't stop right make sure you do."" 

A proactive approach to cleaning and maintaining your truck will help improve the resale value when it comes time to sell. ""Keep it clean, keep it nice. It speaks volumes and pays more when you do it.""

,,90,,,,,,,,Uncategorized,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,873,"There are variables in a truck driver's life that can affect his or her monthly income. A lot of successful drivers have found ways to navigate the variance in income with forward thinking. Some months may be more lean than others, but if you're planning and budgeting for the future, it can help take some of the potential volatility out of it.

""Sometimes freight pay really well and you're doing a lot of miles,"" said Arrow Truck Sales' Jason Church. ""Setting money back is tough to do sometimes.""

""Planning for the future is a really big key and something that's hard to do,"" he said.

The intermingling of personal and truck finances can make things difficult at times, but planning ahead to maintain your unit is crucial, says Church. ""When your tires are wearing thin, and the check engine light is on. You do need to keep up the equipment so you can lean on it. That's what makes your money.""

Proactivity with maintenance can help save money - especially if you've purchased a used commercial vehicle. ""Waiting too long to make a repair typically can snowball into something much worse - and very costly,"" says Church. ""Consistently putting a little money back (is important). A used truck will break. A used truck has used truck problems.""

Throughout the week, law enforcement personnel will be on the lookout for commercial motor vehicle drivers and passenger vehicle drivers engaging in risky driving. Identified unsafe drivers will be pulled over and issued a citation or warning.

Data shows that traffic stops and interactions with law enforcement help reduce problematic driving behaviors. By making contact with drivers during Operation Safe Driver Week, law enforcement personnel aim to make our roadways safer by targeting high-risk driving behaviors.

The emphasis this year is on speeding. ""When you look at the data, speeding has gone up,"" said Kerry Wirachowsky, the Director of CVSA's Roadside Inspection. 

The event doesn't just focus on trucks but any vehicle on the road. ""Operation Safe Driver is a little different in that it doesn't just take into consideration trucks, but also cars around large trucks,"" said Wirachowsky. ""When the police are out their patrolling they're looking for cars cutting off trucks, it's a lot of traffic enforcement.""

"Some Useful Pocket Tools for Truckers | Arrow Truck Sales","As a trucker, you never know where you'll end up needing a tool or assistance. See this guide to learn about some tool options and their uses on the road.",90,18,,,,,,,"Successful Driver",,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/5a9df361-d31b-4044-bbd2-d1a99f9dc32a.jpg,5a9df361-d31b-4044-bbd2-d1a99f9dc32a.jpg,"E:\Sites\arrowtruck_com\blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/5a9df361-d31b-4044-bbd2-d1a99f9dc32a.jpg",882,5a9df361-d31b-4044-bbd2-d1a99f9dc32a,,,,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/5a9df361-d31b-4044-bbd2-d1a99f9dc32a.jpg,,,,,,,,,881,"As a trucker, you never know where you'll end up needing a tool or assistance. Truck stops have limited resources and life on the road is made a lot easier when you have the tools you need. Along with big standard tools, plenty of pocket tools and quick options will make your life more manageable on the road.

A collection of pocket tools will not only provide you with repair options, but many of the tools will help with everyday tasks as you travel from stop to stop on the open road. Check out this guide to learn about some of your tool options and their uses on the road.
<h2>Multi-Tools</h2>
One of the quickest and most efficient tools to bring with you on the road is a multi-tool. The fold-up tools include a lot of compact options. Tools vary by design, but some of the more common options include scissors, knives, screwdrivers, and pliers. A multi-tool provides quick repairs options but also has everyday uses.

For example, if you purchase fresh fruit for the road, a multi-tool is ideal for peeling and slicing the fruit. After driving for a few months, you will have a good idea of what tools you use on a regular basis. From there, you can upgrade your multi-tool to include the exact tools you need for the road.
<h2>Credit Card-Sized Multi-Tools</h2>
An alternate version of the multi-tool is a credit card-sized multi-tool. A flat multi-tool includes different edges and flip-out options. Some of the edges may include sharp edges or jagged edges like a small saw blade. The tools are typically made of durable metal to provide strength. These tools also include cut-out shapes in common bolt sizes to help loosen and tighten various bolts.

The tool is easy to keep in a wallet and pull out in a pinch.
<h2>Tire Gauges</h2>
Air pressure is an essential part of operating a big truck. If your tires have low pressure, you run the risk of a tire popping or lowering your gas mileage and driving efficiency. One of the quickest ways to check the tire pressure on your truck is with a tire gauge. Pocket versions allow you to quickly check the air pressure without the need for a big rig or professional help.

Some of the more advanced pocket gauges include a digital screen. The digital reading takes the guesswork out of a tire gauge and will give you accurate results. Some of the screens feature backlit LCD screens that allow you to see pressure when you check in dark conditions.
<h2>Hex Keys</h2>
When you need to make adjustments or remove bolts, you may run into frustrations when you do not have the proper size. A hex key tool includes a collection of the most sizes for hex bolts. When you use the properly sized tool, you can make adjustments easily and can avoid stripping bolts.

Each tool on a hex key can flip outwards to access the hex bolts one at a time. As you shop for hex keys, look for ones with at least ten different sizes. Some sets will include both metric and standard sizes for the hex key.
<h2>LED Lights</h2>
Advancements in LED lights have created small pocket lights that provide powerful beams and illumination. The lights come in handy when you need to inspect and check your truck at night. Choose from handheld lights or keychain lights you can quickly access.

A small LED headlamp provides a hands-free option when you have to crawl under the truck or need to use multiple tools. LED lights are also useful during the day. Many areas of the truck block out natural sunlight and create areas that are hard to see.

Along with the LED lights, consider an extra stash of backup batteries to help power the lights. You can also shop for LED lights with rechargeable batteries so you can charge the lights while you travel on the road.
<h2>Tool Organizer</h2>
Pocket tools are easy to lose. The last thing you want is to have a convenient tool get jammed in your seat or just go missing. When you purchase pocket tools, consider an easy way to organize all the tools in one place. If you want an enclosed space, shop for small plastic tackle boxes usually reserved for fishing.

A tackle box typically opens up to reveal multiple layers for easy storage. The clips to hold a tackle box shut will prevent the tools from falling out while you drive. If you purchase a truck with a sleeper cabin, then consider a make-up organizer. The open sections of the organizer are easy to place tools in. Keep the organizer inside a cabinet and grab a tool when needed.

One of DEX’s main goals as a company is to eliminate as much down time for a trucker as possible when a breakdownn or accident occurs. It’s no secret that time spent waiting on repairs is money lost for a driver. That’s why DEX’s parts solutions can be so pivotal when a trucker is faced with time off the road.

Darin Redmon, Manager of Operations at DEX Heavy Duty Parts, spoke about this issue on the <a href=""https://www.buzzsprout.com/1678714"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Successful Driver Podcast</a>, saying, “in the event they do have down time, we’re focused on that solution to ge<img class="" wp-image-890 alignright"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/5602763-300x200.jpg"" alt="""" width=""360"" height=""240"" />t them back up and going.” DEX understands that their success as a company is determined by the success of their customers and, in order to be successful, a trucker’s wheels have to be turning.

“If they’re not moving, they’re not making money,” Darin shared with us. Knowing this, DEX focuses on this company motto; “we don’t sell parts, we sell <em>Dexperiences</em>.” The Dexperience, according to Darin, leans heavily on efficiency. Since time is money for a trucker, the total repair experience goes well beyond a part. That’s why DEX wants to make sure the process they offer is as streamlined as possible.

The right tools and products will prevent delays and ensure the trip goes smoothly. As you prepare your truck for long travels, one way to shop for items is through infomercials. Also referred to as ""As Seen On TV"" products, infomercial items include a wide range of gear, gadgets, and novelty items.<!--more-->

When you know what to look for, you can make the most out of the products and find some useful items for the road. Check out this guide to learn what infomercials are geared towards truckers and how to get the most out of these helpful products.
<h2>Cushions</h2>
Comfort is important on the road and infomercials have a lot of items geared towards body relaxation. For your driver's seat, consider an infomercial seat cushion. A variety of cushion products include soft layers and support to prevent aches and tailbone pains. Some cushions will provide proper body posture to prevent spine and muscle pains.

When you're not actively driving, consider infomercial pillows. Travel pillows will include neck pillows for extra support or battery-operated heat pillows to provide comfort. Consider the purchase of lap pillows with built-in straps to prop up media devices like phones and tablets. During a rest, the lap pillow allows you to lay down and easily watch content.
<h2>Portable Lights</h2>
If you park a truck overnight, consider portable lights so you do not need to rely on a truck's battery to provide power and illumination. Portable infomercial lights include a lot of options. Many of the lights tout their long-lasting ability due to low-power LED bulbs. Consider a light you stick to the wall and can easily turn on and off.

A portable flashlight may contain rechargeable batteries or come with a wind-up handle that provides extra power and charge when you manually crank the light. A small light will save your phone's battery power so you don't have to rely on the phone flashlight at night.
<h2>Windshield Items</h2>
A clear windshield makes a world of difference when driving on the road. Dirt, dust, rain, and bugs all create visual hazards. A lot of infomercial products can help minimize visual distractions. Look for a windshield solution that clears up the glass and provides a layer for rainwater to easily run off. When rain dissipates quickly, the glass remains clear.

Windshield cleaners provide long handles to easily reach the glass so you can quickly clean your truck when you park at a rest stop. The extended handle will help reach the side areas where windshield wipers cannot access.

For cold weather situations, look for heated elements. One example includes a heated ice scraper. The heated edges will help melt away layers of ice and allow you to get on the road faster with a cleared windshield. Many of the items are portable or fold up so you can store them inside a truck cab without taking up too much space.
<h2>Organization Products</h2>
After several weeks or months on the road, you will realize how quickly clutter builds up inside a truck cab. Shop for infomercial products with a focus on organization. A variety of products include quick hook options that are made for vehicles or homes. With organizational hooks, you can hang up jackets, bags, and other accessories.

A travel organizer with multiple pockets and open spaces can hang right behind your driver's seat. The organizer is an easy place to store snacks, drinks, maps, or small devices. Truck cabs are a lot different than vehicles, so make sure the products will work well within a truck cab before making your purchase.
<h2>Microwave Products</h2>
If you plan to purchase a sleeper cab for your time on the road, then you may have a small kitchenette area with a built-in microwave. When food is just placed on a plate inside a microwave, you may not have optimal cook options. Infomercial microwave products will help you expand your travel menu and cook foods properly.

Microwave products generally feature a specific cooking option. For example, some are designed to make food crispy while others are made to steam foods like vegetables. Many of the options include single-serving options so you do not waste food while you cook for yourself on the road.

For example, if you enjoy instant noodles, then you could purchase an instant noodle cooker that is shaped to properly cook the meal without the need to boil water. Several products cater to specific foods. You could purchase an egg cooker, taco cooker, or a bacon cooker. If you have specific foods you eat often, then an extra accessory will come in handy.

To save space, you can store the items right inside the microwave when the appliance is not in use.

Once you find a make and model you love, you can go all-in with infomercial products and purchase items that will make life a lot easier on the open road.",,"2021-08-10 19:32:29",post,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/2021/08/10/truckers-guide-infomercial-products-uses/,publish,3,ATSBlogDexM,nrinehart@arrowtruck.com,Dex,Media,truckers-guide-infomercial-products-uses,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2021-08-10 21:06:14"

Recently we concluded our first series on the show, a collection of interviews with DEX Heavy Duty Parts.

We learned a great deal about DEX and the trucking industry in this five-part series.

A driver isn’t just climbing into a truck and hitting the road, there are numerous other unique facets to the job that can make or break someone’s success.</li>

That’s why <a href=""https://www.cvsa.org/"">CVSA</a> aims to remind drivers to keep up with their truck maintenance with Brake Safety Week.

This year’s Brake Safety Week is August 22-28. During this week, commercial vehicle inspectors will spread safety and education across the roadways. Inspectors will be conducting the North <img class=""alignleft wp-image-943"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Fact-1-300x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""383"" height=""383"" />American Standard inspection, focusing heavily on vehicle brake systems and components. Any vehicle found with brake-related out-of-service violations will be removed from the roadways.

Kerri Wirachowsky, Director of CVSA’s Roadside Inspection Program, returned to the <a href=""https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkI4sqcRsy7cOOXIQEG5rG-BBZil0ZC_D"">Successful Driver Podcast</a> to tell us a little bit more about the event. “They may do Level 1 inspections, or they may only do inspections on the brake systems, so they’ll do a Level 4 inspection. They won’t really increase it unless they find something with the brakes.”

Data collected during these inspections will be used to determine any trends found with failing parts. Brake air hoses are one part that inspectors will be looking at closely, comparing the overall efficacy of rubber hoses versus thermal plastic<img class=""alignright wp-image-944"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Fact-2-300x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""383"" height=""383"" /> hoses. They want to know what type of violations these air hoses are found with and how prevalent they are. The data won’t change your inspection, but it will be used to compile better information on the hoses themselves for future use.

It’s important to be proactive with servicing your vehicle, whether it’s commercial or passenger. CVSA announces the dates of its safety weeks in advance to encourage drivers to make the repairs before a surprise inspection occurs. The goal is to educate and promote safety, not to catch drivers unprepared. As Kerri said in her interview, “if you only maintain your truck right before Roadcheck, that’s better than never maintaining it at all.”

<img class=""alignleft wp-image-945"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Fact-3-300x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""383"" height=""383"" />The entirety of August is Brake Safety Awareness Month. Law Enforcement will be working to promote brake safety with commercial drivers, mechanics, owner-operators, motor carriers, and others.

If you’ve been putting off getting your vehicle serviced, this is your sign to make that visit ASAP.

One form of audio to consider is a podcast. Podcasts are released with numerous topics, but one that relates directly to your career is a truck driver podcast. The form of entertainment is not just a way to pass the time but comes with many advantages.

<!--more-->

Check out some of the advantages of listening to a truck driver podcast while on the road.
<h2>1. Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>
A podcast for truck drivers provides tips and tricks from other professionals who have experience on the road. These are the little details to help you get through your daily driving. Road tips can help you navigate through heavy traffic areas or driving through harsh weather conditions like rain and snow.

Truck driving tips could include some of the best devices and gear to use on the road. For example, a trucker could detail their favorite seat cushions and backrests to provide comfort for extended driving times. Tips may include life hacks on the road, including rest stop meal options, ways to pass the time, and tips for sleeping at overnight locations.
<h2>2. Stories From the Road</h2>
You've probably gone through some unique experiences on the road. When you listen to a podcast, you can hear some other funny, sad, and thrilling stories that truck drivers share. A truck driving podcast often features drivers from all over the United States. Hear stories about driving in the South, Northeast, and some of the more unique highways.

The stories not only entertain but can help you prepare for different situations on the road. Learn how to deal with aggressive drivers and how other drivers got through some stressful situations. The stories provide a lot of entertainment and will really help you pass the time as you drive for long stretches.
<h2>3. Loneliness Relief</h2>
The podcasts can help reduce loneliness on the road. The podcasts often feature multiple guests and listening to the conversations can feel like you are listening to a group of friends talk together. The podcast can eliminate some of the loneliness and give you a lot to relate to.

In your everyday life, you may not know many other truck drivers who go through the same experience you have. When you hear similar tales and learn about truckers, you will build the connection directly through the audio. The more you listen to a podcast, the more you will get to know certain personalities and build upon your connection.

Some truck driver podcasts may also feature listener feedback where you can write messages or call in with some of your questions. Take the opportunity to connect directly with the podcast hosts and build upon the connection even further.
<h2>4. Trucking News</h2>
The world of trucking is constantly changing with new laws, regulations, and rules on the road. As a truck driver, staying up to date with the newest trucking news can help keep you safe and informed. Podcasts will often cover the newest trucking news and their take on the news.

The news may also include new truck models and features to consider for future purchases. For example, the world of electric trucks is quickly evolving, and listening to a podcast will provide you with a lot of insight on the future of the technology and what your options are for future truck purchases.

News information could also include data and statistics. Learn about the latest trucker trends, average hours spent on the road, and the impact of holiday travels on the road.
<h2>5. Business Plans &amp; Financial Tips</h2>
Along with news, a big part of truck driving involves financials. You may own your own truck and run your business as an independent contractor. You could own multiple trucks and hire extra drivers to help you with trips. Either way, understanding the business side of trucking is an essential part for many drivers.

Through a podcast, you will hear how others have run their truck businesses over the years. Even more important than the success stories or stories of failure and mistakes. When you hear ways that truck drivers messed up, you can change your own tactics and ensure you do not make the same mistakes.

Learn about everyday expenses, investing for the long term, tax information, and tips for purchasing new trucks. Tax information may include expanded details like write-offs, deductions, and ways to keep track of purchases while on the road. The more you hear about business tips, the more you will naturally learn and use them with your trucking business.

While it may feel natural to compare the purchase of a semi-truck to the purchase of a car, the key role a truck plays in your life and livelihood makes its purchase more comparable to a mortgage than an<img class=""size-medium wp-image-962 alignleft"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/4300874-300x200.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""200"" />ything. With that being the case, it’s easy to see how valuable clear and uncensored information is during (and after) the truck buying experience.

Charles Bowles, the Director of Strategic Initiatives at Commercial Truck Trader, spoke on the value of transparency when he joined us on the <a href=""https://www.buzzsprout.com/1678714"">Successful Driver Podcast</a>. According to Charles, one important thing that transparency achieves is ensuring that everyone remains on the same page. <em>“Ceteris paribus…all things being equal, everybody is on the same playing field.”</em>

Transparency has taken on a new level of importance with the steady growth of online truck shopping and purchasing. Information is expected to be more readily available online, allowing customers to research their purchase well before a decision is made. <em>“When you’re able to work online </em><em>and research (and that’s with forums and third-party marketplaces, that’s on dealer websites) you can collect a lot more information that can help drive your decision.”</em>

When the lifeblood of your business is your truck, its vital to ensure<img class="" wp-image-973 alignright"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/19197265-300x200.jpg"" alt="""" width=""301"" height=""200"" /> that your purchase is well-informed and protected. Arrow’s understanding that time is money is one of the core reasons we work under the tagline of “clear, simple used truck buying”. This process goes beyond truck history, extending to honest discussions about the importance of truck warranties and preventative maintenance. There’s no secret that, when buying a used truck, you need to be prepared for unplanned service requirements. Proper preparation helps mitigate that downtime, making sure you lose out on the smallest amount of time and money as possible.<img class=""size-medium wp-image-964 alignleft"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/2840523-300x200.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""200"" />

<em>“It is extraordinarily important to consider service and maintenance as well as price,”</em> Charles said when discussing the importance of a well-informed buying process. <em>“Price almost becomes secondary to these other important features. It’s more than just the price of the truck, you have to be comfortable with the service and the maintenance and the warranty programs associated with them.”</em>

We sat down with Matt Quick, the Lead Sales Associate at Arrow’s Cincinnati Branch to discuss all things trucking, including the impacts technology and COVID-19 have had on the industry.

When asked how the use of technology has kept truck buying and selling going during the pandemic, Matt said; “We can provide our customers with a lot of audio and video information on the truck to put their mind at ease so<img class=""alignleft wp-image-978"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/3393899-300x200.jpg"" alt="""" width=""321"" height=""214"" /> that they can make the decision on purchasing the truck on the phone, or via email with us, or over text with us without actually seeing the truck. That’s what they need to do to secure their assets today. I think that if it weren’t for some of today’s tools, we wouldn’t be able to get them enough reliable and transparent information as quickly as they need it.”

Being able to interact remotely with customers has been vital during these difficult times, and Arrow has made sure to adapt continuously. While technology has been utilized by the trucking industry for many years, COVID-19 has pushed the importance of conducting business electronically, and Matt doesn’t see things ever fully going back to the way they used to be.

“I don't think it's ever gonna stop, I don't think it's gonna return to the way it used to be. We have always in trucking been a very telecommunicative  industry rather than in-person, we have a lot less people actually come to our lot when they can get the upfront <img class=""size-medium wp-image-979 alignright"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/6531-300x261.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""261"" />information they need over the phone, and luckily for Arrow, and luckily for our customers, over the last 18 months we've been able to stay ahead of the curve with adapting our tools a little more, and now that I think we've made it so easy for the customer with those tools, I don't expect them to go back to doing things the old fashioned way.”

It’s no secret that a used truck will have used truck issues, which is why coverage that caters specifically to trucks with expired factory warranties exists. A basic factory warranty will cover a truck for up to 200,000 miles, or roughly two years. With six out of ten used trucks being likely to experience major equipment failure in their lifetime, you can understand why two years of coverage isn’t enough to fully protect your investment.

Wade Bontrager, CEO of National Truck Protection (NTP) joined us on the <a href=""https://www.buzzsprout.com/1678714"">Successful Driver Podcast</a> to discuss warranties and to share some tips on choosing the program that’s right for you. When asked who needs to consider a warranty, Wade’s simple answer was, “anyone who’s not flush with cash.” To elaborate, he added that “it’s really the smaller guys, the single owner-operators where if they have a $20,000 engine claim or a $25,000 engine claim and they get a couple of those in six months…they’re out of business.”

According to actual claims paid by NTP customers, half of all claims have repair costs of over $5,000 and one in five cost over $10,000. Protecting your truck from equipment failure is big, but how do you know what coverage to get? Wade provided three simple parameters to help first time truck buyers narrow down what they need to select when shopping for warranties.
<h5><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-991"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Slide-1-300x300.png"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""300"" />What components are covered?</h5>
Know what components you want covered and make sure you’re aware of what is part of the plan before purchasing. There is a big difference between full coverage and catastrophic coverage, for example.
<h5><img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-992"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2-300x300.png"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""300"" />What conditions are applied to the coverage?</h5>
It’s important you know how your coverage handles things like deductibles, progressive damage, and pre-existing conditions.

&nbsp;
<h5><img class=""size-medium wp-image-993 alignleft"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/3-300x300.png"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""300"" />How long of a warranty do you need?</h5>
This depends largely on where you are with your finances. For example, Wade recommends you purchase coverage to match the length of your loan if you’re financing a truck.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

“Make sure you look at the covered components and see what's covered and make sure that's covering the things that generally fail and that's what we've tried to accomplish with our products; building a suite of products that really cover those things that fail and doing it very transparently. We want to make sure people know what's not covered as well. Our product has gotten pretty broad, so it covers things like comfort package that does cover things like the radio and air conditioner and radiators, things that aren't normally covered by our market.”

Todd Amen, President and CEO of <a href=""https://www.atbs.com/"">American Truck Business Services (ATBS)</a>, sat down with us to share his advice on how a driver can make their business succeed.

When it comes to trucking, there are multiple factors that contribute to success. While on the surface it may seem as simple as hopping in a truck and driving, anyone in the business knows there’s more to the industry than that. ATBS assists drivers in an area key to their success, their finances. ATBS has been helping drivers with the business side of trucking since 1998 and is now the largest tax and accounting firm serving owner-operators.

<img class=""size-medium wp-image-1029 alignright"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/saving-300x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""300"" />“At ATBS, our goal really is to help the driver treat it like a business. We do a budget, we often call it a ‘profit plan’ because a ‘budget’ sounds like a root canal and a profit plan sounds like something fun.”

There are certain factors that a driver can never truly control. Todd spoke to this when he said that “it literally broke [his] heart when [he] was in the trucking business and [they] had drivers fail for no reason of their own.” There is value to planning for an unforeseen future, whether that includes a tire blowout on the road, a transmission failure, or even an accident. While you can’t control whether these things happen, you can have some control over your response. Saving and practicing healthy budgeting habits is one of the best ways to help yourself prepare for the unexpected.

<img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-1030"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/savings-300x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""300"" />“I think of all kinds of stories of, you know, the ants saving up for dry season and hoarding their harvest underground so that they can eat for long term, we're no different. It's a good time, don't go out and buy new toys like a Harley, or a bass boat, or a bunch of chrome for your truck. Save that money, man, because the tough times will come and you're going to need it to get through the tough time, so put some money in the bank right now, don't just blow it all. It's nice to make money, it's nice to have nice things, but make sure you're building your savings for when the tough time comes.”

Todd shared with us the three main reasons ATBS has seen drivers fail, which include:
<ol>
 	<li><strong><img class=""size-medium wp-image-1027 alignright"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/maintenance-300x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""300"" />Maintenance</strong>: Trucks, especially used trucks, will require maintenance. It’s never a question of if, but when, so plan accordingly. “In today’s world, if you’ve got a used truck, we want people setting aside 10 to 14 cents a mile in a maintenance account. Don’t plan on getting a loan from somebody or a second mortgage to fix something that breaks, do preventative maintenance.”<img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-1026"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Health-blog-300x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""300"" /></li>
 	<li><strong>Health</strong>: You’re just as important to your business as your truck, so when you don’t have your health, your professional life could be affected as well. “Drivers have health issues, their family has health issues…A lot of times, if you’re independent, you don’t have insurance because it’s expensive. So, take care of yourself and try to get some form of health insurance.”</li>
 	<li><strong>Bad Business Practices</strong>: The business side of anything can often be the most frustrating to manage. Between budgeting and making<img class=""size-medium wp-image-1025 alignright"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Business-300x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""300"" /> sure your taxes get paid on time, there are plenty of places where accidents can happen. “Not paying the IRS when you’re supposed to, not paying attention to your numbers…Those are things that cause people to fail, if you can eliminate them by doing the right things, your odds of growing and buying a next truck, and a second truck, and a fifth truck are in your favor.”</li>

Everyone has had their own tips for success; whether that be properly maintaining your truck’s HVAC, or ensuring you’re practicing healthy budgeting habits. Bruce Outridge, host of the <a href=""https://theleadpedalpodcast.com/"">Lead Pedal Podcast</a>, joined us to discuss his past in trucking and to share his top tips for success.

Bruce was in trucking long before he launched his podcast in 2015. In his over thirty years of working in the transportation industry, Bruce has worn many hats; from driver, to owner-operator, to fleet supervisor. Today, <img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-1042"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/resized-truck-300x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""300"" />Bruce owns his own company, Bruce Outridge Productions, and uses his platforms as a podcaster, author, speaker, and producer to share the knowledge he’s gathered over the years. He has produced several programs to help new owner-operators build successful businesses and uses his podcast to chat all things trucking.

Much of Bruce’s time in trucking was spent working as a professional driver. He shared with us four tips to help you succeed when working as a company driver. Most of the advice Bruce shares can be narrowed down to a simple, universal concept; being professional. Personability is one of the top traits that Bruce equates to success; having good customer service and being kind to dispatch goes a long way in Bruce’s book. Punctuality is another big plus according to Bruce, and while that is important in any business, being known to be on time in trucking is a great way to build rapport. Even though you don’t own your truck as a company driver, Bruce emphasizes taking care of the vehicle as if it were your own.

“I always had that mentality that whether I pay for the truck or not, I own the truck, like it was my vehicle. When you take care of it like that and the company realizes you take care of it like that…I never drove old trucks, at the beginning I did for a while, but at the end they were like ‘let's go to the dealership and I'm going to show you the leather seats’ like th<img class=""size-medium wp-image-1043 alignright"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Truck-for-blog-2-300x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""300"" />at's where it was at the end because I took care of that old truck they gave me in the beginning. The drivers that do that, you will find that companies kind of leave them alone. When a company finds a guy who will take care of their equipment like it's their own vehicle, is going to be on time, is willing to do the work and get the job done...they're not going to bug you so that you leave, they want to keep you.”

<h2><span style=""font-size: 28px; font-weight: 900;"">1. Tips &amp; Tricks</span></h2>
A podcast for truck drivers provides tips and tricks from other professionals who have experience on the road. These are the little details to help you get through your daily driving. Road tips can help you navigate through heavy traffic areas or driving through harsh weather conditions like rain and snow.

Truck driving tips could include some of the best devices and gear to use on the road. For example, a trucker could detail their favorite seat cushions and backrests to provide comfort for extended driving times. Tips may include life hacks on the road, including rest stop meal options, ways to pass the time, and tips for sleeping at overnight locations.
<h2>2. Stories From the Road</h2>
You've probably gone through some unique experiences on the road. When you listen to a podcast, you can hear some other funny, sad, and thrilling stories that truck drivers share. A truck driving podcast often features drivers from all over the United States. Hear stories about driving in the South, Northeast, and some of the more unique highways.

The stories not only entertain but can help you prepare for different situations on the road. Learn how to deal with aggressive drivers and how other drivers got through some stressful situations. The stories provide a lot of entertainment and will really help you pass the time as you drive for long stretches.
<h2><span style=""font-size: 28px; font-weight: 900;"">3. Loneliness Relief</span></h2>
The podcasts can help reduce loneliness on the road. The podcasts often feature multiple guests and listening to the conversations can feel like you are listening to a group of friends talk together. The podcast can eliminate some of the loneliness and give you a lot to relate to.

In your everyday life, you may not know many other truck drivers who go through the same experience you have. When you hear similar tales and learn about truckers, you will build the connection directly through the audio. The more you listen to a podcast, the more you will get to know certain personalities and build upon your connection.

Some truck driver podcasts may also feature listener feedback where you can write messages or call in with some of your questions. Take the opportunity to connect directly with the podcast hosts and build upon the connection even further.
<h2><span style=""font-size: 28px; font-weight: 900;"">4. Trucking News</span></h2>
The world of trucking is constantly changing with new laws, regulations, and rules on the road. As a truck driver, staying up to date with the newest trucking news can help keep you safe and informed. Podcasts will often cover the newest trucking news and their take on the news.

The news may also include new truck models and features to consider for future purchases. For example, the world of electric trucks is quickly evolving, and listening to a podcast will provide you with a lot of insight on the future of the technology and what your options are for future truck purchases.

News information could also include data and statistics. Learn about the latest trucker trends, average hours spent on the road, and the impact of holiday travels on the road.
<h2><span style=""font-size: 28px; font-weight: 900;"">5. Business Plans &amp; Financial Tips</span></h2>
Along with news, a big part of truck driving involves financials. You may own your own truck and run your business as an independent contractor. You could own multiple trucks and hire extra drivers to help you with trips. Either way, understanding the business side of trucking is an essential part for many drivers.

Through a podcast, you will hear how others have run their truck businesses over the years. Even more important than the success stories or stories of failure and mistakes. When you hear ways that truck drivers messed up, you can change your own tactics and ensure you do not make the same mistakes.

Learn about everyday expenses, investing for the long term, tax information, and tips for purchasing new trucks. Tax information may include expanded details like write-offs, deductions, and ways to keep track of purchases while on the road. The more you hear about business tips, the more you will naturally learn and use them with your trucking business.

"Male Truck Drivers and Mental Health | Arrow Truck Sales","If you are a male truck driver, read our blog to learn about some tips you can follow to improve your mental well-being on the road.",90,,1|1,1|1,,,,,Uncategorized,,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/person-thinking-about-mental-health.jpg,person-thinking-about-mental-health.jpg,"E:\Sites\arrowtruck_com\blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/person-thinking-about-mental-health.jpg",1053,person-thinking-about-mental-health,,,,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/person-thinking-about-mental-health.jpg,,,,,,,,,1052,"Men make up the majority of long-haul truck drivers, and they face many occupational stressors as they traverse the country, carrying goods from place to place. But the long hours and isolating nature of the job doesn't just affect their physical health — life on the road can also take a toll on their mental health. Here's a look at the common emotional struggles of many male truck drivers and tips to improve mental well-being on the road.

<!--more-->
<h2>What Does a Snapshot of Male Truck Drivers and Mental Health Look Like?</h2>
In 2012, <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22757596/"">researchers</a> randomly surveyed 316 male truck drivers between 23 and 76 years of age at a large truck stop near Greensboro, North Carolina. Participants were given an 82-item questionnaire to fill out, and the results were telling. Truckers reported significant mental health issues:
<ul>
 	<li>27.9 percent reported loneliness</li>
 	<li>26.9 percent reported depression</li>
 	<li>20.6 percent reported chronic sleep disturbances</li>
 	<li>14.5 percent reported anxiety</li>
 	<li>13 percent reported other emotional problems</li>
</ul>
These figures are concerning, especially when one considers women are more likely to be diagnosed with anxiety and depression.

Why is depression and related mental health issues so prevalent among male truck drivers? It’s likely that traditional masculinity and the fear of displaying weakness along with a reluctance to discuss feelings plays a role.

Many men also struggle with the extended separation from their families. Husbands and fathers routinely miss out on family events, holidays, and the joy of seeing their children grow. Long times out on the road can be very stressful in a marriage or relationship. And even if a trucker doesn't have a family waiting at home, it can be difficult to feel a part of the community they call home when they're so rarely there.
<h2>How Can a Truck Driver Take a Proactive Approach to Mental Health?</h2>
Life in an 18-wheeler may present obstacles most Americans don't have to deal with, but truck drivers can take a few steps to improve their mental health while rolling down the interstate.

<em>Improve Your Diet</em>

<a href=""https://www.nrcmetrainingonline.com/hot-topics/63-obesity-among-truck-drivers-part-of-a-national-crisis"">Eighty-six percent</a> of American truck drivers are obese, far exceeding the general population. Obesity brings a host of additional physical health problems as well as self-esteem issues. This statistic shouldn't be surprising, as the nature of the job requires a sedentary lifestyle, with long hours spent sitting in the driver's seat. Typical high-calorie truck stop fare doesn't help, either.

As a truck driver, rather than eating at a fast food restaurant or diner when you pull in to fuel up, expand your onboard pantry and meal prep capabilities. For example, stock up on quick and healthy snacks that can help you cut back on fast food and gas station stops. A bag of apples, a bunch of bananas, and assorted mixed nuts will help keep you full.

Additionally, adding a power inverter to your sleeper compartment can improve the quality of the foods you eat. With a power inverter, you can expand your options with appliances such as a mini fridge, electric skillet, microwave, or slow cooker.

With this equipment and a stocked pantry, you can make soups, sandwiches, reheat leftovers, and more. Not only will you feel better eating whole foods and nourishing homemade meals, you'll save money too.
<h3>Get Moving</h3>
According to the US National Library of Medicine, regular aerobic exercise can alleviate anxiety and depression and relieve feelings of low self-esteem and social withdrawal. Regular exercise can also improve sleep and increase mental alertness, which is key for a long haul truck driver.

Truckers may not be able to go for long jogs, but studies show as little as 30-minute brisk walks three times a week have health benefits such as weight control, increased energy, and reduced blood pressure. And the 30-minute walks can be broken up, too. Three 10-minute walks throughout the day are just as beneficial as a continuous session.

You should also get to know the amenities at the truck stops you frequent. Some locations have small gyms on-site, perfect for when you're off-duty. Any physical activity you can work in throughout the day will only benefit your mental well-being.
<h3>Explore Your Faith</h3>
Many people turn to organized religion or spiritual pursuits to help them cope with the stresses of life. A deep belief in a higher power or the tenets of a specific religion can be very comforting to some. Many religions or spiritual practices have specific doctrines that apply to mental health struggles as well, and some find comfort coming together with other believers.

Unfortunately, many truck drivers are not able to regularly, physically participate in formal religious institutions because of job responsibilities. Thankfully, there are alternatives. With a turn of the radio dial, you can find religious-oriented programming. Podcasts are another option, and dozens of truck stops have on-site ministries.

Truckers keep our country moving, surviving, and thriving through their work. Without them, every aspect of life as we know it would come to a screeching halt.

"Truck Driver Hauling Options | Arrow Truck Sales","As a new truck driver, one of the biggest things to consider is what kind of material you will drive on the road. Check out options to consider and avoid.",30,19,1,1,,,,,Blog,,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Truck-Driver-Hauling-Options-What-to-Consider-and-Avoid.jpg,Truck-Driver-Hauling-Options-What-to-Consider-and-Avoid.jpg,"E:\Sites\arrowtruck_com\blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Truck-Driver-Hauling-Options-What-to-Consider-and-Avoid.jpg",1057,"Three big lorry trailers in grey color","Three big lorry trailers in grey color",,,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Truck-Driver-Hauling-Options-What-to-Consider-and-Avoid.jpg,,,,,,,,,1056,"As a new truck driver, the cab you purchase can be used for a plethora of job options, and the field is typically wide open with choices. When you choose a hauling option, many factors go into the decision including the pay, hours on the road, and the distance you will actually drive. One of the biggest considerations is what kind of material you will drive on the road.

<!--more-->

The load you carry daily can make a big difference in the way you drive and your duties as a driver. The more you learn about your driving choices, the better decision you can make for your first journey on the road. Check out four options ideal for new truck drivers and one you should avoid until you have more experience.
<h2>Consider Dry Van Haulers</h2>
One of the most common trucks you will see on the road is a dry van hauler. Essentially, this is the big rectangular cargo trailer that many big rigs drive to deliver goods across the United States. Many companies rely on drivers to haul their goods and distribute them among stores.

As you seek out a job, you may find companies hiring truck drivers just for their products. Dry van haulers often have the simple task of driving, parking, and placing the truck next to a loading deck. From there, a crew will often deal with loading and unloading products.

Dry van haulers include a lot of driving options as well. In some cases, you may get home on the weekends and not have to do extended trips. Some warehouses may keep your delivery just to local areas and allow you to return home multiple days a week.
<h2>Consider Refrigerated Haulers</h2>
One career path similar to dry van haulers is a refrigerated hauler. The truck cargo often looks the same but includes refrigeration technology to keep products at a certain temperature. Typically, a refrigerated hauler is for food-based products. Deliveries may include grocery stores, restaurants, or schools.

Like dry van haulers, a refrigerated loader will typically only include parking duties. One of the extra responsibilities for a driver is to ensure the temperature remains consistent in the hauler and no major issues occur. Typically, tools and dashboard access right inside the truck will showcase the temperatures.

When you seek out a career as a refrigerated hauler, you might see the job position listed as a reefer. This information can help you quickly scan job searches and find gigs you want.
<h2>Consider Dry Tanker Haulers</h2>
While truck drivers who transport refrigerated or dry van materials are typically completed products, you also have the option to start your truck career as a dry tanker hauler. A dry tanker includes a large tank that carries dry materials. The dry materials could include anything from flour to sugar or powdered chemicals.

As part of the tank, you will learn how to connect hoses and other tools to transport the materials from the dry tank into the new location where the materials go to. The company that hires you will typically go through the training process, as every dry tanker could feature different mechanics and operations.

After a few trips, you will likely be fully used to the process and can help transfer the raw materials with ease.
<h2>Consider Flatbed Truck Trailers</h2>
For a little more physical work, consider a career as a flatbed truck trailer driver. The flatbeds will typically haul materials that can withstand outdoor elements. The materials may include construction materials like lumber or large pipes. Securing the load properly to the flatbed is an important aspect of the job.

You also have the responsibility of adding tarps over the load when necessary. If you transport items like haystacks or bags of soil, you do not want items to fly off the back of the trailer and create any issues. You will learn how to climb on top of the trailer, securely attach tarps, or use machinery that can automatically extend tarps across the rear of a trailer.
<h2>Avoid Liquid Tankers</h2>
While a dry tanker offers fairly easy transportation options for a trained driver, you should have a few years’ experience on the road before you venture into the world of liquid tankers. Liquid tankers may carry a wide range of materials including filtered pool water, oil, gasoline, or chemicals for various plants and companies.

Not only is the material itself often hazardous, but the liquid can cause major changes while you drive. Truck drivers must take different precautions as liquid moves back and forth and up and down through a tank. You need to learn proper road awareness and truck handling before you take on the gig.

"Truck Driving in Winter Weather | Arrow Truck Sales","Winter weather can create slick road conditions and reduce visibility while driving. Get some tips for how to drive safely in these conditions.",30,19,1|1,1|1,,,,,Blog,,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/0f578e1b-3f72-4ae3-b077-62e6a79780af.jpg,0f578e1b-3f72-4ae3-b077-62e6a79780af.jpg,"E:\Sites\arrowtruck_com\blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/0f578e1b-3f72-4ae3-b077-62e6a79780af.jpg",1060,"Snowstorm, poor visibility,slick roads and lots of traffic","Snowstorm, poor visibility,slick roads and lots of traffic",,,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/0f578e1b-3f72-4ae3-b077-62e6a79780af.jpg,,,,,,,,,1059,"Over 70 percent of all roads in the United States are located in regions that receive over 5 inches of snow every year during the winter, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. Not only can winter precipitation combined with cold temperatures create slick road conditions, but it can also reduce visibility while driving. For this reason, every truck driver should learn how to stay safe when driving on snow- and ice-covered roads, whether they live in a snowy region of the country or not.

<!--more-->

Read on to learn five tips for driving safely in harsh winter weather.
<h2>1. Increase Following Distance When Driving on Wet and Icy Roads</h2>
According to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), motor vehicle collisions that involve large trucks most often occur when the truck collides with the vehicle in front of them.

For this reason, one of the most effective ways to avoid collisions with other motor vehicles when driving on snow- and ice-covered roads during the winter is to increase your following distance. All truck drivers should maintain about one second of following distance between their vehicle and the one in front of them for every 10 feet of vehicle length when driving at slower speeds during non-adverse weather conditions.

However, you should double this following distance during adverse weather conditions to compensate for the increase in braking distance that accompanies driving on slick road surfaces. When braking on icy or snowy roads, it can take up to 10 times longer for your truck to stop than it does when braking on clear roadways.
<h2>2. Know When and Where Black Ice Typically Forms</h2>
Black ice is a hazard when driving on winter roads, because unlike traditional ice that is often white in appearance, black ice is clear and invisible to the naked eye. For this reason, many truckers do not realize that there is a patch of black ice on the road they are driving on until they actually begin driving on the slick ice.

However, when you learn when and where black ice typically forms, you can prepare yourself for this potential adverse road condition when necessary to help prevent unnecessary surprises while driving.

Black ice most commonly develops when weather is hovering just above or around 32 degrees F and is less common when temperatures are extremely frigid. This ice type typically forms during the night or early morning hours on shaded areas of roadways that receive little traffic. Common black ice locations include under highway overpasses and on overpasses and bridges.

When encountering a patch of black ice, remain calm, drive slowly over the ice, and avoid hitting your breaks until you pass over the icy patch. Most black ice patches are no longer than <a href=""https://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd488148.pdf"">20 feet in length</a>.
<h2>3. Remove Snow from All Lights and Reflectors Regularly</h2>
Even high-quality exterior lights and reflectors that are in great condition can become covered with snow and ice that reduces their light output and visibility during the winter. For this reason, you should remove snow and ice from <em>all</em> exterior truck lights and reflectors every time you stop when driving in snowy conditions.

Unfortunately, some truckers make the mistake of clearing the snow off the lights on the front of their trucks alone while forgetting to clear the snow from their back truck lights, such as their tail and brake lights. This mistake can make a truck less visible drivers behind you on the road during adverse weather conditions, increasing the chance that one will rear-end the truck.
<h2>4. Never Be Afraid to Take a Bad-Weather Break</h2>
One mistake many truck drivers make during the winter is feeling like they always have to keep their trucks moving towards their destinations, even when harsh winter weather decreases road visibility greatly. However, you should never be afraid to remove your truck from the roadway and take a break when your driving visibility has declined to a point where you no longer feel safe on the road.

All bad weather conditions, such as heavy snowfall, eventually pass. For this reason, taking a break during adverse weather can often help keep you and other drivers on the road safe without increasing your route time dramatically.
<h2>5. Know How to Clear Ice and Snow From Stuck Tires</h2>
After pulling over to take a break from driving in snowy weather, you may occasionally find that your truck tires are stuck in snow and will not budge when you attempt to drive away. For this reason, you should learn how to free your tires when they become stuck in snow and ice now instead of panicking later when it happens.

Many truckers free tires stuck in snow by engaging their clutches, fueling the engine slightly, and gently rocking the truck and tires until they can drive away. However, some truck drivers instead keep bags of clay-based cat litter in their truck cabins and sprinkle the litter around their tires when they are stuck in snow to provide much-needed traction that the tires can use to free themselves.

As a self-employed business owner, it’s important to take action now to ensure you have enough money to retire at a comfortable financial level.
<h3>Knowing Your Needs</h3>
<img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-1064"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Blog-Img-1-300x200.png"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""200"" />While saving is a challenge, mastering the art of controlling spending will help you ensure you have enough money post-retirement to maintain your lifestyle. The earlier you begin to save, the better off you’ll be, since any money you invest will compound and grow over a longer period of time. Finding ways to live comfortably on less will also make it easier to make your savings last longer in your retirement years.

How much should you save? Figure out how much it costs you to live by adding up the cost of housing, food, transportation, travel, entertainment, and any other monthly expenses you may have. Account for a yearly inflation rate of approximately 3 percent, and try to estimate any increases or decreases, such as medical or housing costs. Next, use an online calculator to estimate your life expectancy. Try more than one, using factors such as medical conditions to determine how many years of retirement to plan for.
<h3>Savings and Social Security</h3>
Although many Americans rely on their Social Security check each month, don’t count on it being enough to fully support you in retirement. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, Social Security provides approximately 40 percent of the income the average person received prior to retirement. Although estimates vary on how much you’ll need to live on depending on your post-retirement expenses, financial experts say you’ll likely need 75 to 80 percent of your pre-retirement income.

For example, if you’re unmarried and your income is $100,000 annually before taxes, you may choose a target of 75 percent. If you anticipate approximately $26,000 per year in Social Security benefits, then you’ll need to replace $49,000 per year with income from other sources such as dividends from investments, retirement funds, or income from a part-time job.

Remember to carefully weigh your options when choosing whether or not to begin receiving Social Security benefits early. You have the option to begin early at age 62, at full retirement age (age 66 or 67, depending on when you were born), or later. If you claim early, your benefit will be reduced to 75 percent of your full monthly benefit and will remain at that reduced benefit for the rest of your life. However, if you wait to take Social Security until full retirement age, you’ll need to live longer to make up for the payments you could have been receiving.
<h3>Choosing a Retirement Plan</h3>
A qualified retirement account makes sense because you don’t pay taxes on the earnings until you begin withdrawing the funds. Since you won’t be taking out the money until you retire, you should be in a lower tax bracket then and therefore paying less in taxes than you would if you paid the taxes now. Many retirement plans also allow you to deduct your contributions to the plan from your income. So, if you made $60,000 and contributed $5,000 to your plan, you would report $55,000 on your income tax return.

What are the options? For owner-operators, Individual Retirement Accounts are a popular choice.

<strong>Traditional IRA.</strong> For those without an employer-sponsored account, a traditional individual retirement account allows you to contribute $6,000 per year if you’re under 50 and up to $7,000 per year for those 50 and older. Investments grow tax deferred until the investor withdraws funds during retirement.

<strong>Roth IRA.</strong> The biggest difference between a Roth and a traditional individual retirement account is how they are taxed. Roth IRAs are not pre-taxed, so the contributions are not tax-deductible. However once you begin to withdraw money, those funds are tax free. Also, the Roth IRA has a limit on how much yearly income you can have while contributing – if you will make more than $144,000 (single) in 2022 or $214,000 as a married couple filing jointly, you can’t contribute to a Roth IRA.

<strong>401(k)</strong>

The attractiveness of a Roth IRA is that you can withdraw funds tax-free once you are retired. However, if earlier tax advantages are more suitable for you, a 401(k) might be a better option. These accounts allow you to contribute prior to income tax deduction and often have much higher contribution limits than Roth IRAs. For individuals wishing to take advantage of higher limits, in 2021 the Roth 401(k) limit was $19,500 for those under 50 and $26,000 for individuals 50 and over, compared to $6,000 and $7,000 for the Roth IRA. Additionally, if you are a company employee, 401(k) accounts allow employers to make matching contributions. The downside to a 401(k) is limited flexibility, so if you want more control over your funds, an IRA might be a better option.
<h3>Finding Assistance</h3>
<img class=""alignleft size-medium wp-image-1065"" src=""http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Blog-Img-2-300x200.png"" alt="""" width=""300"" height=""200"" />No matter what path you take to securing your future, you needn’t go at it alone. You can find basic tools online for free, and online brokers can assist you in setting up accounts. For more in-depth assistance, talk to your accountant about retirement planning. If you’re starting from scratch on savings and investments, consider hiring a financial planner to walk you through the process. It could be the best investment you’ll ever make.",,"2022-01-27 21:02:16",post,http://www.arrowtruck.com/blog/2022/01/27/ensuring-finances-future/,publish,1,ATSBlogM,schaiyote@arrowtruck.com,,,ensuring-finances-future,,,0,0,0,closed,open,"2022-01-27 21:02:16"
